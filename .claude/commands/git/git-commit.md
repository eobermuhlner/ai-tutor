description: Create a git commit following project commit guidelines
---

Create a git commit following these MANDATORY rules:

## Commit Message Format (REQUIRED)

**First line**: Concise summary in imperative mood, no period
**Body** (optional): Brief explanation of what and why (one sentence per line)

‚ö†Ô∏è **ABSOLUTELY NO AI ATTRIBUTION** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- ‚ùå NEVER include "Generated with Claude Code"
- ‚ùå NEVER include "Co-Authored-By: Claude"
- ‚ùå NEVER include ANY AI attribution or references

## Examples

‚úÖ **CORRECT:**
```
Add effectivePhase to separate user preference from active phase

User-controlled conversationPhase (Auto/Free/Correction/Drill) now separate from effectivePhase (actual active phase).
LLM suggestions only update effectivePhase when in Auto mode, never override manual user choices.
```

‚ùå **WRONG:**
```
Add effectivePhase to separate user preference from active phase

User-controlled conversationPhase now separate from effectivePhase.

ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

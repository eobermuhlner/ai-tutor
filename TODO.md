# Bugs

- Fix level + categories in Course page

# List of TODOs and ideas for future features

- Session list must show Tutor + Course name. Remove "Conversation"
- User must give OpenAI key in self-registration or later in Profile, if not defined as env var
- Lessons with some tracking mechanism to track whether the lesson is finished. Get rid of "weeks" in lessons.
- Vocabulary lists, similar to lessons (maybe integrated in lessons?)
- Image URL to external imagestore stored in tutor and word cards ...
- Person images with age range: age_20 -> age_20_30

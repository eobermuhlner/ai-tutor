## Grammar Focus

### Business Email Structure
**Rule:** Professional business emails follow a standard structure for clarity and efficiency

**Components:**
1. **Subject Line** - Concise summary of email content
2. **Salutation** - Appropriate greeting based on recipient relationship
3. **Opening** - Brief introduction or reference to previous communication
4. **Body** - Clear, organized presentation of main points
5. **Closing** - Summary, next steps, or call to action
6. **Sign-off** - Professional closing phrase
7. **Signature** - Sender's contact information

### Subject Lines
**Rule:** Subject lines should be specific, concise, and informative

**Good Practices:**
- Keep under 50 characters when possible
- Use action-oriented language
- Include project or reference identifiers
- Avoid vague terms like "Hello" or "Information"

**Examples:**
- **Good:** "Q3 Marketing Budget Approval - Project Phoenix"
- **Poor:** "Hi there" or "Quick question"

**Specific Subject Line Types:**
- **Action Required:** "ACTION REQUIRED: Contract Review by Friday"
- **Meeting Request:** "Meeting Request: Q4 Planning - November 15"
- **Follow-up:** "FOLLOW-UP: Proposal Discussion - Marketing Campaign"
- **Information Sharing:** "INFO: Updated Company Policies - Effective Jan 1"
- **Confirmation:** "CONFIRMATION: Interview Scheduled - March 10"

### Salutations
**Rule:** Choose salutation based on relationship level and formality requirements

**Formal (Unknown Recipient/External):**
- "Dear Mr. Smith,"
- "Dear Dr. Johnson,"
- "Dear Ms. Williams,"
- "Dear Professor Brown,"

**Semi-formal (Known Recipient/Professional):**
- "Dear Sarah,"
- "Dear James,"
- "Dear Team,"

**Informal (Close Colleague/Internal):**
- "Hi Sarah,"
- "Hello James,"

**No Name Available:**
- "Dear Hiring Manager,"
- "Dear Customer Service Team,"
- "To Whom It May Concern," (very formal, use sparingly)

### Email Body Structure
**Rule:** Organize email body for maximum readability and response efficiency

**Paragraph Organization:**
1. **Opening Paragraph:** Purpose/context/reference
2. **Main Content Paragraphs:** Key information, organized logically
3. **Closing Paragraph:** Summary/action items/next steps

**Effective Paragraph Structure:**
- One main idea per paragraph
- Clear topic sentences
- Supporting details or examples
- Logical flow between paragraphs

### Opening Paragraphs
**Rule:** Establish context and purpose immediately

**Common Opening Types:**
- **Reference to Previous Communication:** "Following up on our discussion..."
- **Introduction of New Topic:** "I am writing to propose..."
- **Response to Inquiry:** "Thank you for your email regarding..."
- **Scheduled Communication:** "As discussed in our meeting..."

**Examples:**
- "I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to follow up on our meeting yesterday regarding the marketing campaign."
- "Thank you for your email of March 5th concerning the project timeline."
- "I am reaching out to propose a revised approach to our current strategy."

### Main Content Paragraphs
**Rule:** Present information clearly and concisely

**Organization Techniques:**
- **Chronological:** "First, we will... Next, we plan to... Finally,..."
- **Order of Importance:** "Most importantly... Additionally... Furthermore..."
- **Problem-Solution:** "We have identified... To address this, we propose..."
- **Question-Answer:** "You asked about... Our response is..."

**Bullet Points and Numbered Lists:**
- Use for multiple items or steps
- Keep items parallel in structure
- Begin with action verbs when possible

**Example with Bullet Points:**
"I would like to outline the key components of our proposal:
• Market analysis and competitive landscape
• Implementation timeline with milestones
• Resource allocation and budget requirements
• Expected ROI and success metrics"

### Closing Paragraphs
**Rule:** Summarize key points and specify next steps

**Common Closing Elements:**
- **Summary:** "To summarize, we recommend..."
- **Call to Action:** "Please review the attached document and provide feedback by..."
- **Deadline:** "We would appreciate your response by..."
- **Next Steps:** "I will follow up next week to discuss..."

**Examples:**
- "I look forward to your feedback on this proposal by Friday. Please let me know if you have any questions."
- "Thank you for considering these recommendations. I am available to discuss further at your convenience."

### Sign-offs
**Rule:** Choose sign-off based on formality level and relationship

**Formal:**
- "Sincerely,"
- "Best regards,"
- "Kind regards,"
- "Respectfully,"
- "Yours faithfully," (when name unknown)

**Semi-formal:**
- "Best,"
- "Thanks,"
- "Regards,"

**Informal:**

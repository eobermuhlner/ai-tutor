## This Week's Goals

- Learn proper placement of adjectives in American English sentences
- Master comparative and superlative forms with American preferences
- Understand adverb formation from adjectives in American context
- Use degrees of comparison accurately in American English

## Grammar Focus

### Adjective Position

**Rule:** Adjectives typically come before the noun they modify in English.

Examples:
- **A red car** is parked outside
- I bought **three expensive books**
- She has **a beautiful house**

Exception: Some adjectives come after linking verbs (be, seem, appear)
- The car **is red**
- The books **are expensive**

### American English Comparative and Superlative Forms

**Rule:** Form comparatives with -er/more and superlatives with -est/most. American English has some preferences.

Regular adjectives:
- Short (1-2 syllables): tall → taller → tallest
- Long (3+ syllables): beautiful → more beautiful → most beautiful

Examples:
- Comparative: She is **taller** than her sister
- Superlative: She is **the tallest** in her family
- Long adjectives: He is **more careful** than before / **the most careful** student

### American vs British Preference in Degrees of Comparison

**Rule:** Some preferences differ between American and British English.

Examples:
- American: "more common" preferred (less likely to use "commoner")
- British: "more common" or "commoner" (both acceptable)
- American: "farther" and "further" often used interchangeably
- British: more specific usage (farther for distance, further for abstract)
- American: "different from" or "different than" (both common)
- British: "different from" preferred

### Irregular Comparatives and Superlatives

| Adjective | Comparative | Superlative | Note |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|------|
| good/well | better | best | Standard |
| bad | worse | worst | Standard |
| far | farther/further | farthest/furthest | American: often interchangeable |
| little | less | least | Standard |
| much/many | more | most | Standard |
| old | older/elder | oldest/eldest | Older for age, elder for family |

### Adverb Formation (American Context)

**Rule:** Most adverbs are formed by adding -ly to adjectives. American English has some preferences.

Examples:
- Quick → quickly: He runs **quickly**
- Careful → carefully: Drive **carefully**
- Special → especially: This is **especially** important

American preference: "Different from" or "different than" (both acceptable)

### Complete Comparison Table (American Focus)

| Adjective | Comparative | Superlative | Example (Comparative) | American Note |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|---------------|
| tall | taller | tallest | He is taller than me | Standard |
| happy | happier | happiest | She is the happiest | Standard |
| beautiful | more beautiful | most beautiful | She is more beautiful | Standard |
| expensive | more expensive | most expensive | This is most expensive | Standard |
| good | better | best | He is better at math | Standard |

**Negative form:** He is not taller than his brother. / The task is not difficult.
**Question form:** Is she taller than her sister? / Is this the best option?

## Essential Vocabulary

### Supporting Vocabulary
- **adjective** - word describing a noun
- **adverb** - word modifying verb, adjective, or other adverb
- **comparative** - comparing two things
- **superlative** - comparing among three or more
- **linking verb** - connects subject to description

### American Comparative Adverbs
- **Comparing manner:** more carefully, less quickly, better, worse
- **Comparing degree:** more, less, very, extremely, quite, rather, really

### American vs British Adverb Usage
- American: "I really like it" (meaning 'very much')
- British: "I quite like it" (meaning 'rather')
- American: "on the weekend" vs. British "at the weekend"
- American: "I'm done" vs. British "I've finished" (completion)

## Conversation Scenarios

### Describing and Comparing Things in American Context

Practice comparing people, places, and things using proper comparative and superlative forms in the American style, and describing actions with appropriate adverbs.

Key grammar to practice:
- "This book is more interesting than that one" (comparative)
- "She runs faster than I do" (adverb comparative)
- "He speaks English very well" (adverb)
- "This is the most beautiful place I've seen" (superlative)

## Practice Patterns

- Convert adjectives to adverbs with American preferences
- Form comparative and superlative sentences with American usage
- Identify correct adjective position in sentences
- Distinguish between adjectives and adverbs in American context
- Create sentences using irregular comparatives and superlatives

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- "She is more taller" → "She is taller" (double comparative)
- "He runs good" → "He runs well" (use adverb with verbs)
- "She sings beautiful" → "She sings beautifully" (use adverb to describe action)
- "He is the most tallest" → "He is the tallest" (double superlative)
- "The weather is more better" → "The weather is better" (wrong comparative form)

## Cultural Notes

American English often uses "really" in a way that might be overused compared to British "quite": "I really like it" meaning "I very much like it." Also, American English commonly uses "different than" in addition to "different from" when comparing, which is less accepted in British English. American English also uses "I'm done" to mean "I have finished," which is less common in British English.

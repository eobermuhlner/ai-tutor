## This Week's Goals

- Master the structure and use of zero conditional for general truths in American English
- Learn first conditional for real future possibilities with American usage
- Understand second conditional for unreal present situations in American context
- Begin third conditional for unreal past situations in American English

## Grammar Focus

### Zero Conditional (American Usage)

**Rule:** Use present simple in both clauses for scientific facts or general truths.

Structure: If + present simple, present simple

Examples:
- If you heat ice, it melts
- If it rains, the ground gets wet
- When I'm tired, I sleep

### First Conditional (American Usage)

**Rule:** Use present simple in if-clause and will + base verb in main clause for real future possibilities.

Structure: If + present simple, will + base verb

Examples:
- If it rains tomorrow, I will stay home
- I will call you if I have time
- If you study hard, you will pass the exam

### Second Conditional (American Usage)

**Rule:** Use past simple in if-clause and would + base verb in main clause for unreal present situations. American English often accepts "If I was" in informal contexts, though "If I were" is more formal.

Structure: If + past simple, would + base verb

Examples:
- If I had more money, I would travel the world
- I would be happy if I won the lottery
- If I were you, I would take that job (formal American)
- If I was you, I would take that job (informal American)

### Complete Conditional Reference Table (American Focus)

| Type | If-Clause (Condition) | Main Clause (Result) | American Usage Note | Example |
|------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Zero | Present Simple | Present Simple | General truth | If you mix oil and water, they separate |
| First | Present Simple | Will + Base Verb | Real future | If I have time, I will help you |
| Second | Past Simple | Would + Base Verb | Unreal present | If I were rich, I would buy a yacht |
| Third | Past Perfect | Would have + Past Participle | Unreal past | If I had studied, I would have passed |

### Third Conditional (American Usage)

**Rule:** Use past perfect in if-clause and would have + past participle in main clause for unreal past situations.

Structure: If + past perfect, would have + past participle

Examples:
- If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam
- I would have called you if I had known your number

### Mixed Conditionals (American Usage)

**Rule:** Combine different conditional structures for complex time situations. American English uses these for nuanced expression.

Examples:
- If I had won the lottery (past), I would be rich now (present)
- If I were rich now (present), I would have bought a car (past ability)

### American vs British Conditional Usage

**Rule:** American English sometimes uses different constructions than British English.

Examples:
- American: I would have liked to see it
- British: I would have liked to have seen it
- American: If I won, I would be happy (less formal "If I were to win")
- British: More likely "If I were to win, I would be happy" (formal)

### American Informal Second Conditional

**Rule:** American English often uses "If I was" instead of "If I were" in informal contexts.

Examples:
- Formal: If I were rich, I would travel the world
- Informal: If I was rich, I would travel the world

**Negative form:** If I didn't work here, I wouldn't know him. / If I had studied, I wouldn't have failed.
**Question form:** What would you do if you won the lottery? / Would you go if you were invited?

## Essential Vocabulary

### Supporting Vocabulary
- **conditional** - expressing a condition or dependency
- **clause** - part of a sentence containing subject and verb
- **subjunctive** - mood expressing what is hypothetical
- **counterfactual** - contrary to fact

### American Conditional Connectors
- **If:** If it rains, we'll stay inside
- **Unless:** Unless you hurry, you'll be late (meaning "if not")
- **As long as:** I'll help as long as you need
- **Provided that:** You can borrow my car provided that you return it
- **In case:** I'll take an umbrella in case it rains

## Conversation Scenarios

### Hypothetical Situations and Possibilities in American Context

Practice forming conditional sentences when discussing possibilities, making plans, and talking about unreal situations with American English preferences, especially noting the informal use of "If I was."

Key grammar to practice:
- "If I have time, I will visit you" (first conditional)
- "If I was taller, I would play basketball" (informal second conditional)
- "If I had known, I would have helped" (third conditional)
- "What would you do if you won a million dollars?" (American currency reference)

## Practice Patterns

- Complete conditional sentences with correct verb forms using American preferences
- Identify which conditional type is being used
- Transform sentences from one conditional type to another
- Create conditional sentences based on given situations
- Distinguish between formal and informal conditional usage in American context

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- "If I will go, I will call you" → "If I go, I will call you" (don't use will in if-clause)
- "If I would study, I would pass" → "If I studied, I would pass" (wrong second conditional)
- "If I was you" → "If I were you" (American informal vs formal)
- "If I would have known" → "If I had known" (wrong third conditional)
- "If I will have time" → "If I have time" (don't use will in if-clause)

## Cultural Notes

American English is more accepting of "If I was" in second conditional than British English, which prefers "If I were" consistently. Also, American English often simplifies formal conditionals: "If I won the lottery" instead of "If I were to win the lottery" compared to British English.

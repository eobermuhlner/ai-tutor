## This Week's Goals

- Learn to form passive voice constructions in various tenses in American English
- Understand when to appropriately use passive voice in American context
- Recognize passive voice in different tenses with American preferences
- Identify when the agent is included or omitted in passive constructions in American English

## Grammar Focus

### Basic Passive Voice Formation (American Usage)

**Rule:** Form passive voice with "be + past participle" (object becomes the subject).

Active: Subject + verb + object
Passive: Object + be + past participle + (by subject)

Examples:
- **Active:** The chef cooks the meal
- **Passive:** The meal **is cooked** by the chef

### Passive Voice in Different Tenses (American Focus)

**Present Simple:** am/is/are + past participle
- The house **is cleaned** every day

**Past Simple:** was/were + past participle
- The letter **was written** yesterday

**Future Simple:** will be + past participle
- The report **will be completed** tomorrow

**Present Perfect:** has/have been + past participle
- The project **has been finished**

**Past Perfect:** had been + past participle
- The cake **had been eaten** when I arrived

### Complete Passive Tense Reference Table (American Focus)

| Tense | Active Example | Passive Structure | Passive Example | American Note |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Present Simple | I write letters | am/is/are + past participle | Letters **are written** | Standard |
| Past Simple | I wrote letters | was/were + past participle | Letters **were written** | Standard |
| Future Simple | I will write | will be + past participle | Letters **will be written** | Standard |
| Present Perfect | I have written | have/has been + past participle | Letters **have been written** | Less common than British |
| Past Perfect | I had written | had been + past participle | Letters **had been written** | Standard |
| Present Continuous | I am writing | am/is/are being + past participle | Letters **are being written** | Standard |
| Past Continuous | I was writing | was/were being + past participle | Letters **were being written** | Standard |

### When to Use Passive Voice in American English

**Rule:** American English uses passive voice less frequently than British English, especially preferring active voice in informal contexts.

Examples:
- **American preference:** The researchers **analyzed** the results carefully (active)
- **Less common American:** The results **were analyzed** carefully (passive)
- **Unknown agent:** My car **was stolen** (who doesn't matter - both acceptable)
- **Emphasis on object:** The bridge **was built** in 1990 (acceptable when needed)

### Passive with Modals (American Usage)

**Rule:** Use modal + be + past participle. American English uses passive modals but often prefers active voice.

Examples:
- The letter **should be sent** immediately
- The work **must be completed** by Friday
- The car **might be repaired** by tomorrow

### American vs British Passive Voice Usage

**Rule:** American English tends to use active voice more frequently than British English, particularly in informal contexts.

Examples:
- American: The team **is investigating** the matter (active)
- British: The matter **is being looked into** by the team (passive)
- American: The manager **approved** the request
- British: The request **was approved** by the manager
- American: Academic writing still uses passive, but less than British

**Negative form:** The report is not finished. / The house has not been cleaned.
**Question form:** Was the letter sent? / Has the work been completed?

## Essential Vocabulary

### Supporting Vocabulary
- **passive voice** - subject receives the action
- **active voice** - subject performs the action
- **agent** - the one performing the action
- **transitive** - verb that takes a direct object
- **past participle** - form used in passive and perfect tenses

### American Passive Constructions
- **With agent:** The cake was made by my grandmother
- **Without agent:** The cake was made yesterday
- **Mention agent with:** The house was built by the company
- **American preference:** Often omit "by agent" when not important

### American Causative Passive
- **Have something done:** I had my car repaired
- **Get something done:** I got my hair cut (both used, with slight difference in meaning)

## Conversation Scenarios

### Formal and Informal Contexts Using Passive in American English

Practice when to use passive voice appropriately in American English, especially noting that Americans prefer active voice in informal contexts but may use passive in formal writing.

Key grammar to practice:
- "The new law is being discussed" (present continuous passive - acceptable)
- "The building was constructed in 1990" (past simple passive)
- "The report must be submitted by Friday" (modal passive)
- "The project has been completed" (present perfect passive)

## Practice Patterns

- Convert active sentences to passive voice with American preferences (when appropriate)
- Identify the correct passive form for different tenses
- Choose when passive voice is more appropriate than active in American context
- Complete passive sentences with correct verb forms
- Distinguish between when Americans prefer active vs. passive voice

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- "The cake was ate" → "The cake was eaten" (wrong past participle)
- "I was borned in 1990" → "I was born in 1990" (wrong past participle)
- "The book was wrote by him" → "The book was written by him" (wrong past participle)
- "The house built by him" → "The house was built by him" (missing auxiliary)
- "He was interested on music" → "He was interested in music" (wrong preposition)

## Cultural Notes

American English tends to use active voice more frequently than British English, especially in informal writing and speech. However, passive voice is still used in American English in formal writing, scientific contexts, and when the doer of the action is unknown or unimportant. Americans often prefer "We investigated the issue" over "The issue was investigated" in everyday communication.

## Conversation Scenarios

### Discussing Time and Location in American Context

Practice using prepositions correctly when talking about time, location, and direction in American English conversations, especially focusing on differences from British English.

Key grammar to practice:
- "I will meet you at the university at 3 PM" (American article usage)
- "The book is on the table next to the computer" (location)
- "She walked from the car into the building" (direction)
- "I'll see you on the weekend" (American time expression)

## Practice Patterns

- Choose the correct preposition for time expressions with American usage
- Identify appropriate prepositions for spatial relationships in American context
- Form sentences using prepositions of direction
- Create sentences with common prepositional phrases
- Complete gaps with the correct preposition in American English

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- "I will meet you in 3 PM" → "I will meet you at 3 PM" (wrong time preposition)
- "I live in New York Street" → "I live on New York Street" (wrong place preposition)
- "I go to hospital" → "I go to the hospital" (British usage)
- "I go to university" → "I go to the university" (British usage)
- "She arrived to the airport" → "She arrived at the airport" (wrong arrival preposition)

## Cultural Notes

In American English, there are specific preposition differences from British English: Americans say "on the weekend" while Britons say "at the weekend." Also, American English always uses articles with institutions: "in the hospital" vs. British "in hospital," and "at the university" vs. "at university" in British English. These article requirements are consistent in American English.

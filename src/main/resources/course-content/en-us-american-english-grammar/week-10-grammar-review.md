## This Week's Goals

- Review and consolidate all major grammar points covered in the American English course
- Practice integrating multiple grammar concepts in complex sentences with American preferences
- Identify and correct common grammatical errors specific to American English
- Develop confidence in using grammar structures in American context

## Grammar Focus

### Comprehensive Grammar Integration (American Focus)

**Rule:** Combine multiple grammar concepts learned throughout the course to form complex, nuanced sentences with American English preferences.

Examples integrating multiple concepts:
- **Simple Past for Recent Activity:** I **already ate** lunch (American preference over present perfect)
- **Conditionals + Passive:** "If I **had been invited**, I **would have attended**" (American conditional usage)
- **Collective Nouns:** "The team **is playing** well" (American singular verb agreement)

### Complex Sentence Structures (American Style)

**Rule:** Combine simple clauses using coordinating and subordinating conjunctions to form complex sentences with American preferences.

Examples:
- **Compound:** I studied hard, **and** I passed the exam
- **Complex:** Although I was tired, I continued working
- **American:** It's important that he **attend** the meeting (subjunctive without "should")

### Complete Grammar Review Table (American Focus)

| Grammar Point | American Structure | Example | British Difference |
|---------------|-------------------|---------|-------------------|
| Present Tense | Subject + base verb (+s for 3rd person) | She **works** daily | Same |
| Past Tense | Subject + past form | I **visited** yesterday | Same |
| Present Perfect vs Simple Past | Simple past for recent events | I **already ate** | British: I **have already eaten** |
| Articles | A/An/The + noun | **A book** / **The book** | American: "at the university" vs "at university" |
| Comparatives | More/more + adj. or adj. + -er | More beautiful / Taller | Same |
| Prepositions | Verb + preposition | Go **to** school | American: "on the weekend" vs "at the weekend" |
| Pronouns | Subject/Object forms | **She** knows **me** | American: "team is" vs "team are" |
| Modals | Modal + base verb | I **can** swim | American: Rarely use "shall" |
| Conditionals | If-clause + main clause | If I study, I will pass | American: "If I was" informal |
| Passive | Be + past participle | The book **was written** | American: Prefer active voice |

### American vs British Grammar Differences

**Rule:** Several grammatical structures differ between American and British English.

Examples:
- **Present Perfect vs Simple Past:** American: "I already ate" vs British: "I have already eaten"
- **Collective Nouns:** American: "The government is" vs British: "The government are"
- **Have/Have Got:** American: "Do you have a pen?" vs British: "Have you got a pen?"
- **Prepositions:** American: "on the weekend" vs British: "at the weekend"
- **Subjunctive:** American: "It's important that he be there" vs British: "It's important that he should be there"

**Negative form:** I do not have finished the work yet. / The letter was not sent.
**Question form:** Have you finished the work? / Where was the letter sent?

## Essential Vocabulary

### Supporting Vocabulary
- **syntax** - arrangement of words and phrases
- **morphology** - form and structure of words
- **agreement** - matching between subject and verb, noun and adjective
- **coherence** - logical connection between ideas

### American Grammar Review Terms
- **Simple sentence:** Contains one independent clause
- **Compound sentence:** Contains two or more independent clauses
- **Complex sentence:** Contains one independent and one or more dependent clauses
- **Formal American:** Uses less passive voice than British formal writing

### American Advanced Constructions
- **Subjunctive mood:** If I **were** rich (unreal condition - formal American)
- **Causative:** I had my car **repaired**
- **Simple Past:** Emphasis on completion of recent actions

## Conversation Scenarios

### Integrating All Grammar Concepts in American Context

Practice using a combination of all grammar concepts learned in the course when engaging in more complex conversations using American English preferences.

Key grammar to practice:
- "If I had studied harder, I might have been more successful" (complex conditional with modal)
- "The team is playing well, and they have been doing so consistently" (collective noun with singular verb and present perfect)
- "I already ate, so I'm not hungry" (American simple past for recent action)
- "Do you have any questions?" (American "do you have" construction)

## Practice Patterns

- Create complex sentences combining multiple grammar concepts with American preferences
- Identify American vs British grammar differences in complex sentences
- Correct sentences containing multiple errors in American context
- Transform simple sentences into compound or complex sentences using American structures
- Practice advanced structures like simple past for recent past activities

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- **Present Perfect vs Simple Past:** "I have already eaten" → "I already ate" (American preference for simple past)
- **Collective nouns:** "The team are" → "The team is" (American singular agreement)
- **Have/Have got:** "Have you got a pen?" → "Do you have a pen?" (American preference)
- **"If I was" vs "If I were":** "If I were you" (formal American) vs "If I was you" (informal American)
- **Prepositions:** "at the weekend" → "on the weekend" (American usage)

## Cultural Notes

American English often uses simpler sentence structures than British English in informal contexts. In written American English, especially in business writing, there's a preference for active voice over passive voice, though both are used. American English also emphasizes simple past for recent activities rather than present perfect: "I already ate" vs. British "I have already eaten." Americans also tend to use more direct communication, often preferring active voice and clearer subject-verb relationships.

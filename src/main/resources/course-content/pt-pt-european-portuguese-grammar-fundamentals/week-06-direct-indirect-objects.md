## Grammar Focus

### Direct Object Pronouns (Pronomes Objeto Direto)

**Rule:** Direct object pronouns replace direct objects (what/whom the action is done to).

**European Portuguese Direct Object Pronouns:**
- **me** - me (me)
- **te** - you (you)
- **o** - him/it (masculine) or you (formal singular)
- **a** - her/it (feminine) or you (formal singular)
- **nos** - us (us)
- **vos** - you (plural formal/informal - less used in Portugal)
- **os** - them (masculine) or you (plural formal)
- **as** - them (feminine) or you (plural formal)

### Direct Object Pronoun Placement

**Rule:** Place direct object pronouns before conjugated verbs or attach them to infinitives/gerunds/imperatives.

**Before Conjugated Verbs:**
- **Eu o vejo** (I see him/it)
- **Tu a conheces** (You know her)

**Attached to Infinitives:**
- **Vou vê-lo** (I'm going to see him)
- **Preciso comprá-la** (I need to buy it)

**Attached to Gerunds:**
- **Estou lendo-o** (I'm reading it)
- **Continuo vendo-a** (I continue seeing her)

**With Imperatives:**
- **Vê-lo!** (See it!)
- **Dá-la para mim!** (Give it to me!)

| Ele/Ela/Você | o | a | os | as |
| Nós | os | as | os | as |
| Vós | os | as | os | as |
| Eles/Elas/Vocês | os | as | os | as |

### Indirect Object Pronouns (Pronomes Objeto Indireto)

**Rule:** Indirect object pronouns indicate to whom or for whom the action is done.

**European Portuguese Indirect Object Pronouns:**
- **me** - to/for me
- **te** - to/for you (informal)
- **lhe** - to/for him/her/you (formal)
- **nos** - to/for us
- **vos** - to/for you (plural formal/informal - less used in Portugal)
- **lhes** - to/for them/you (plural formal)

### Indirect Object Pronoun Placement

**Rule:** Indirect object pronouns follow the same placement rules as direct object pronouns.

**Before Conjugated Verbs:**
- **Eu lhe dou o livro** (I give him the book)
- **Tu nos ajudas** (You help us)

**Attached to Infinitives:**
- **Vou falar-lhe** (I'm going to talk to him)
- **Preciso ajudar-vos** (I need to help you)

**Attached to Gerunds:**
- **Estou falando-lhe** (I'm talking to him)

| Vós | vos (to/for you) | vos (to/for you) |
| Eles/Elas/Vocês | lhes (to/for them/you) | lhes (to/for them/you) |

### Combining Direct and Indirect Object Pronouns

**Rule:** When using both direct and indirect object pronouns, follow specific ordering rules.

**Normal Order:** Indirect object pronoun + Direct object pronoun
- **Eu lho dou** (I give it to him) - lhe (indirect) + o (direct)
- **Tu lha dás** (You give it to her) - lhe (indirect) + a (direct)

**Special Cases with Third Person:**
- When both pronouns would start with l-, change indirect to se
- **Eu se o vejo** (I see him) - se (indirect) + o (direct)

**Examples:**
- **Eu lho dou** (I give it to him)
- **Tu lhas dás** (You give them to her)
- **Ele mo dá** (He gives it to me)
- **Nós vo-los damos** (We give them to you)
- **Vós no-las dais** (You give them to us)
- **Eles vo-las dão** (They give them to you)

### Complete Infinitive/Gerund/Imperative Table

| Verb Form | Pronoun Placement | Example | Translation |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|-------------|
| Infinitive | Attached with hyphen | Vou **vê-lo** | I'm going to see him |

| Gerund | Attached with hyphen | Estou **lendo-o** | I'm reading it |

### Special Considerations

**Rule:** Some special rules apply to object pronoun usage.

**Clitic Pronouns:**
- Object pronouns are clitics, meaning they attach to other words
- **O vejo** (I see him) - o is attached to vejo
- **Vê-lo** (to see him) - o is attached to ver

**Double Pronoun Order:**
- When both pronouns start with the same letter, special combinations occur
- **Me o** → **Mo** (I see him - contracted)
- **Te a** → **Ta** (I see her - contracted)
- **Lhe o** → **Lho** (I give it to him - contracted)

**Lhe vs. O/A:**
- **lhe** is used for indirect objects (to/for someone)
- **o/a** is used for direct objects (something/someone)
- **Dou o livro a ele** → **Dou-lhe o livro** (I give him the book)

**Se vs. Lhe:**
- When both direct and indirect pronouns start with l-, use se for indirect
- **Vejo ele** → **Vejo-o** (I see him - direct)
- **Digo a ele** → **Digo-lhe** (I tell him - indirect)
- **Digo a ele sobre isso** → **Digo-lho** (I tell him about it - indirect + direct)

### Demonstrative Examples

**Rule:** Object pronouns in context.

**Daily Situations:**
- **Viste o filme? Sim, **vi-o** ontem** (Did you see the movie? Yes, **I saw it** yesterday)
- **Escreveste para os teus pais? Sim, **escrevi-lhes** semana passada** (Did you write to your parents? Yes, **I wrote to them** last week)
- **Trouxeste-me os documentos? Sim, **trouxe-tos** (Did you bring me the documents? Yes, **I brought them to you**)

**Professional Context:**
- **Pode enviar o relatório ao diretor? Claro, **envio-lho** imediatamente** (Can you send the report to the director? Of course, **I'll send it to him** immediately)
- **Receberam as informações? Sim, **recebemo-las**** (Did they receive the information? Yes, **we received them**)

**Social Interaction:**
- **Encontraste a Maria? Sim, **encontrei-a** no parque** (Did you meet Maria? Yes, **I met her** in the park)
- **Apresentaste os amigos? Sim, **apresentei-os**** (Did you introduce the friends? Yes, **I introduced them**)

**Negative form:** **Não o vi** (I didn't see him) / **Não lhes escrevi** (I didn't write to them)
**Question form:** **Viste-o**? (Did you see it?) / **Onde a colocaste**? (Where did you put it?)

## Conversation Scenarios

### Using Object Pronouns in Daily Context

Practice using direct and indirect object pronouns when describing giving, receiving, and doing things for others.

Key grammar to practice:
- **Viste o filme? Sim, vi-o ontem** (Did you see the movie? Yes, I saw it yesterday)
- **Escreveste para os teus pais? Sim, escrevi-lhes semana passada** (Did you write to your parents? Yes, I wrote to them last week)

- **Pode enviar o relatório ao diretor? Claro, envio-lho imediatamente** (Can you send the report to the director? Of course, I'll send it to him immediately)

## Practice Patterns

- Replace nouns with appropriate object pronouns
- Place object pronouns correctly in sentences
- Combine direct and indirect object pronouns
- Use object pronouns with infinitives and gerunds
- Distinguish between direct and indirect objects
- Apply special combination rules

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- **Vou o ver** → **Vou vê-lo** (incorrect pronoun placement)
- **Escrevi lhes** → **Escrevi-lhes** (pronoun should be attached)
- **Dá-mo ele** → **Dá-mo** (unnecessary redundancy)
- **Vi o-lo** → **Vi-o** (double object pronoun)
- **Falei com eles sobre isso** → correct, but **Falei-lhes sobre isso** → also correct (pronoun usage)
- **Trouxe te os documentos** → **Trouxe-tos** (incorrect placement)

## Cultural Notes

In European Portuguese, the correct use of direct and indirect object pronouns is essential for clear communication and shows attention to grammatical precision. Unlike English, European Portuguese allows for more flexible pronoun placement, especially in literary contexts. In European Portuguese, many of the contracted pronoun forms (mo, to, lho) are less used in modern speech compared to Brazilian Portuguese, with speakers preferring the full pronoun forms (me o, te a, lhe o). Understanding and correctly using object pronouns helps avoid ambiguity in Portuguese, where subject pronouns are often omitted. European Portuguese speakers also appreciate when learners make an effort to use correct pronoun placement, as it demonstrates respect for the language's grammatical structure. The distinction between formal (lhe/lhes) and informal (te/vos) pronouns is also crucial in European Portuguese social interactions. In Portugal, the vos form is rarely used in everyday speech, unlike in some Latin American countries.

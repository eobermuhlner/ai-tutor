- Você vai estudar? (Are you going to study?)
- Nós vamos comer (We're going to eat)

### Simple Future Tense

**Rule:** Add future endings to infinitive

-AR/-ER/-IR: -ei, -á, -á, -emos, -ão, -ão

Examples:
- Eu falarei (I will speak)
- Você falará (You will speak)
- Nós falaremos (We will speak)

**Note:** Ir + infinitive is more common in speech

### Expressing Intentions

**Rule:** Use querer (want), esperar (hope), pretender (intend)

Examples:
- Eu quero viajar (I want to travel)

## This Week's Goals

- Express completed actions
- Use 了 le for past
- Use 过 guo for experience
- Describe past events

## Grammar Focus

### Particle 了 Le (Completed Action)

**Rule:** Verb + 了 le indicates completed action

Examples:
- 我吃了饭 Wǒ chī le fàn (I ate/have eaten)
- 我去了北京 Wǒ qù le Běijīng (I went to Beijing)
- 你买了什么？Nǐ mǎi le shénme? (What did you buy?)

Negative: 没(有) méi(yǒu) + verb (no 了!)
- 我没吃饭 Wǒ méi chī fàn (I didn't eat)
- 我没去北京 Wǒ méi qù Běijīng (I didn't go to Beijing)

### Particle 过 Guo (Past Experience)

**Rule:** Verb + 过 guo indicates "have done before"

Examples:
- 我去过中国 Wǒ qù guo Zhōngguó (I have been to China before)
- 你吃过北京烤鸭吗？Nǐ chī guo Běijīng kǎoyā ma? (Have you eaten Peking duck before?)

Negative: 没 méi + verb + 过 guo
- 我没去过中国 Wǒ méi qù guo Zhōngguó (I haven't been to China)

### 了 Le vs 过 Guo

- 了 le: Specific completed action
- 过 guo: General experience

Compare:
- 我去了中国 Wǒ qù le Zhōngguó (I went to China - specific trip)
- 我去过中国 Wǒ qù guo Zhōngguó (I've been to China before - experience)

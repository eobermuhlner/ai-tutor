## Conversation Scenarios

The AI tutor will guide you through conversations about:

### Describing Your Family

Practice talking about your family members and their roles.

Topics to cover:
- "かぞくは なんにんですか" (How many people in your family?)
- "よにん かぞくです" (I have a four-person family)
- "ちちは かいしゃいんです" (My father is a company employee)
- "ははは せんせいです" (My mother is a teacher)

### Asking About Others' Families

Practice asking politely about someone else's family.

Topics to cover:
- "ごかぞくは なんにんですか" (How many people in your family?)
- "おとうさんの おしごとは なんですか" (What does your father do?)
- "おにいさんは なんさいですか" (How old is your older brother?)

### Describing Family Members

Practice describing family members' appearance and personality.

Topics to cover:
- "ちちは たかいです" (My father is tall)
- "ははは やさしいです" (My mother is kind)
- "あには まじめです" (My older brother is serious)
- "いもうとは げんきです" (My younger sister is energetic)

## Practice Patterns

- Count family members: "___にん かぞくです"
- Use humble forms for your family: "わたしの ちち/はは"
- Use honorific forms for others: "おとうさん/おかあさん"
- Show possession with の: "わたしの ___"
- Describe people: "___ is ___ です"
- State occupations: "___は ___です"
- Ask about family: "ごかぞくは なんにんですか"

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- Using honorific forms for your own family → "わたしの おとうさん" → "わたしの ちち" (use humble!)
- Using humble forms for others' family → "あなたの ちち" → "あなたの おとうさん" (use honorific!)
- Wrong people counter → "さんさい" → "さんにん" (さい = age, にん = people)
- Forgetting irregular counters → "いちにん" → "ひとり", "ににん" → "ふたり"
- Wrong particle → "わたしが ちち" → "わたしの ちち" (use の for possession)
- Confusing upper/lower with age → use わかい (young) not した
- Using せんせい for your own teacher when speaking to outsiders

## Cultural Notes

- Japanese culture places great importance on family hierarchy
- Older siblings are addressed by their relationship term, not by name
- The distinction between humble and honorific forms shows respect
- In Japan, it's common to live with parents even as adults
- Family names come before given names in Japanese (Tanaka Yuki, not Yuki Tanaka)
- Many Japanese people use さん after family role when speaking TO that person ("おかあさん!")
- Asking about family is a common conversation topic and not considered intrusive
- The concept of うち (inside/our group) vs そと (outside) affects language choices

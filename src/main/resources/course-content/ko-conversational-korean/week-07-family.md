## This Week's Goals

- Talk about your family members in Korean
- Use possessive particle 의 correctly
- Describe family relationships
- Learn Korean age and kinship system

## Grammar Focus

### Possessive Particle 의 (ui/e)

**Rule:** Links nouns to show possession (often omitted in casual speech)

Examples:
- 저**의** 가족 (jeo-**ui** ga-jok) - my family (formal)
- 제 가족 (je ga-jok) - my family (contracted, common)
- 친구**의** 언니 (chin-gu-**ui** eon-ni) - friend's older sister
- 한국**의** 문화 (han-guk-**ui** mun-hwa) - Korea's culture

**Note:** In casual speech, 의 is often dropped:
- 나 친구 (na chin-gu) - my friend (casual, 의 omitted)

### Family Counter: 명 (myeong) vs 분 (bun)

**명 (myeong)** - people (general):
- 두 명 (du myeong) - two people

**분 (bun)** - people (honorific):
- 두 분 (du bun) - two people (respectful)

Use 분 when talking about elders or to show respect.

### Age Expressions

**Native Korean numbers + 살 (sal):**
- 스물다섯 살 (seu-mul-da-seot sal) - 25 years old

**Asking age (informal):**
- 몇 살이에요? (myeot sal-i-e-yo?) - How old are you?

**Asking age (formal/respectful):**
- 연세가 어떻게 되세요? (yeon-se-ga eo-tteo-ke doe-se-yo?) - What is your age? (very polite)

## Practice Patterns

- Describe family: "가족이 [number] 명이에요"
- Use possessive: "저의 가족" or contracted "제 가족"
- Ask about siblings: "형제자매가 있어요?"
- Express age: Native number + 살
- Use proper terms based on speaker's gender: 형/오빠, 누나/언니
- Use honorifics for elders: 부모님, 할아버지, 할머니

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- Using wrong sibling term for speaker's gender (male says "형", female says "오빠")
- Forgetting that 동생 is gender-neutral ("younger sibling")
- Not distinguishing between formal (아버지/어머니) and casual (아빠/엄마)
- Confusing 살 (age) with 쌀 (rice) - pronunciation matters!
- Not using honorific particle 님 with parents when showing respect
- Forgetting Korean age system counts from conception (traditionally 1 year older)
- Using Sino-Korean numbers for age instead of Native Korean
- Not recognizing that kinship terms are more complex in Korean due to hierarchy

## Grammar Focus

### Formal vs. Informal Address

**Rule:** Use "tu" (informal you) with friends, family, and children. Use "vous" (formal you) with strangers, elders, colleagues, and service staff. When in doubt, always start formal.

Examples:
- Informal: "Comment vas-tu?" (How are you? - to friends)
- Formal: "Comment allez-vous?" (How are you? - to strangers/elders)
- Informal: "Tu peux m'aider?" (Can you help me? - to friend)
- Formal: "Pouvez-vous m'aider?" (Can you help me? - to stranger)

### Polite Requests and Expressions

**Rule:** Use "s'il vous plaît" (please - formal), "merci" (thank you), and "de rien" (you're welcome) frequently. Use "Je voudrais..." (I would like...) for polite requests.

Examples:
- "Je voudrais un café, s'il vous plaît" (I would like a coffee, please)
- "Puis-je passer?" (May I pass? - very polite)
- "Pardon" (Sorry / Excuse me)
- "Excusez-moi" (Excuse me - getting attention)

- "Bon appétit" (Enjoy your meal - said to others)
- "L'addition, s'il vous plaît" (The bill, please)

## Practice Patterns

- Navigate a formal introduction and determine when appropriate to switch from vous to tu
- Order dinner at a restaurant following local meal timing and etiquette
- Make appropriate small talk without asking culturally inappropriate questions
- Attend a social gathering and use proper greetings and farewells
- Handle a situation where you unintentionally violated a cultural norm

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- Using "tu" with elders or strangers → Use "vous" until invited to use tu (shows respect)
- Saying "Bonjour" in the evening → Use "Bonsoir" after 6pm (important distinction!)
- Eating dinner at 6pm in France → Most restaurants open 7:30-8pm, dinner eaten 8-10pm (major timing difference)
- Forgetting "s'il vous plaît" and "merci" → Use these constantly (considered essential politeness, not optional)
- Not greeting shopkeepers → Always say "Bonjour" when entering shops (mandatory, shows respect)
- Skipping the "bonjour" before requests → ALWAYS greet first, then make requests (critical French etiquette)
- Speaking too loudly → French conversation is generally quieter than American. Loud talking is considered rude.
- "Excusez-moi" vs "Pardon" confusion → "Excusez-moi" to get attention, "Pardon" after bumping someone

## Cultural Notes

- **"Bonjour" is mandatory**: ALWAYS say "Bonjour" (or "Bonsoir" after 6pm) when entering shops, restaurants, elevators with people. Not greeting is extremely rude in French culture.
- **Meal times**: Lunch 12-2pm, dinner 7:30-10pm. Restaurants close between meals. French meals are leisurely - expect 1.5-2 hours for dinner.
- **No snacking culture**: French don't typically snack between meals. "Le goûter" (4pm snack) is mainly for children.
- **Greeting customs**: Cheek kissing ("la bise") is common among friends/family (2 kisses, sometimes 3-4 depending on region). Between strangers, handshakes. Wait for French people to initiate la bise.
- **Personal space**: French use slightly closer personal space than Americans during conversation, but less than Southern Europeans. Don't back away.
- **Tipping culture**: Service is INCLUDED in French bills by law (15%). Additional tipping is optional - leave small change or round up (1-2 euros) for good service. Never 15-20% like in the US.
- **Punctuality**: For social events, being 10-15 minutes late is acceptable (fashionably late). For business meetings, be on time. For dinner invitations, 15 minutes late is polite.
- **Directness with politeness**: French communication can be more direct than Anglo cultures, but ALWAYS use polite forms. Bluntness without "s'il vous plaît" is very rude.
- **Tu vs. Vous**: This distinction is critical. Using "tu" with strangers/service staff is disrespectful. Wait for the other person to suggest "on se tutoie?" (should we use tu?).
- **Dress code**: French dress more formally than Americans. Jeans are acceptable but should be neat. Athletic wear is for sports only, not casual wear.
- **"Non" is direct**: French often say "non" directly without softening. This isn't rude - it's normal communication. Americans may find it abrupt.
- **Hand gestures**: French use expressive hand gestures in conversation. This is normal, not anger.
- **Wine culture**: Wine is part of French meals and culture. If offered wine and you don't drink, politely decline: "Non merci, je ne bois pas."
- **Bread etiquette**: Break bread with hands, don't cut. Place bread directly on table, not on plate. Use bread to push food onto fork.
- **Public displays of affection**: Generally more accepted than in some cultures. Couples commonly kiss in public.
- **Formality in business**: Initial business meetings are formal. Use titles (Monsieur, Madame, Docteur) and vous. Relationships develop slowly.
- **Religion and secularism**: France is officially secular ("laïcité"). Religion is private. Avoid asking about religion in casual conversation.
- **Queue culture**: French don't always queue in obvious lines. Position yourself clearly at service counters.

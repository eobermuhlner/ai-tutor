## Grammar Focus

### Formal vs. Informal Address (Lei vs. Tu)

**Rule:** Use "lei" (formal you) with strangers, elders, colleagues, and service staff. Use "tu" (informal you) only with friends, family, and children. When in doubt, always use lei.

Examples:
- Formal: "Come si chiama?" (What's your name? - formal)
- Informal: "Come ti chiami?" (What's your name? - informal)
- Formal: "Può aiutarmi?" (Can you help me? - formal)
- Informal: "Puoi aiutarmi?" (Can you help me? - informal)

### Polite Requests and Expressions

**Rule:** Use "per favore" (please) frequently and "Scusi" (excuse me) when interrupting. These are essential for Italian politeness.

Examples:
- "Per favore" (Please)
- "Prego" (You're welcome / Please, go ahead)
- "Scusi" (Excuse me - formal)
- "Mi dispiace" (I'm sorry)

- "Avete un menù del giorno?" (Do you have a menu of the day?)
- "Buon appetito" (Enjoy your meal - said to others)
- "Il conto, per favore" (The bill, please)
- "Il servizio è incluso?" (Is service included?)

## Practice Patterns

- Navigate a formal introduction and determine when appropriate to switch from lei to tu
- Order dinner at a restaurant following local meal timing and etiquette
- Make appropriate small talk without asking culturally inappropriate questions
- Attend a social gathering and use proper greetings and farewells
- Handle a situation where you unintentionally violated a cultural norm

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- Using "tu" with elders or strangers → Use "lei" until invited to use tu (shows respect)
- Saying "Buongiorno" in the evening → Use "Buonasera" after 2-3pm (important distinction!)
- Eating dinner at 6pm in Italy → Most restaurants open 7:30-8pm, dinner eaten 8-10pm
- Forgetting "per favore" and "grazie" → Use these constantly (essential politeness)
- Not greeting shopkeepers → Always say "Buongiorno" when entering shops (mandatory!)
- Skipping the greeting before requests → ALWAYS greet first, then make requests (critical!)
- Ordering cappuccino after meals → Italians drink cappuccino only at breakfast (major faux pas)
- "Scusi" vs "Mi dispiace" confusion → "Scusi" to get attention, "Mi dispiace" to apologize

## Cultural Notes

- **"Buongiorno" is mandatory**: ALWAYS say "Buongiorno" (or "Buonasera" after 2-3pm) when entering shops, restaurants, elevators with people. Not greeting is very rude in Italian culture.
- **Meal times**: Lunch 12:30-2:30pm, dinner 7:30-10pm. Restaurants may close between services (3-7pm). Italian meals are leisurely - expect 2+ hours for dinner.
- **"Pausa" (break time)**: Many shops close 1-4pm for lunch break, especially outside major cities. Respect this cultural norm.
- **Aperitivo culture**: Pre-dinner drinks ("aperitivo") 6-8pm with snacks. Popular social activity. Not a full meal, but substantial.
- **Greeting customs**: Cheek kissing ("baci") is common among friends/family (2 kisses, starting left cheek). Between strangers, handshakes. Wait for Italians to initiate.
- **Personal space**: Italians use closer personal space than Northern Europeans during conversation, but less touching than stereotype suggests.
- **"Coperto" and tipping**: Service is included in bills via "coperto" charge (1-3 euros). Additional tipping is optional - round up or leave small change (1-2 euros) for good service. NOT 15-20% like in US.
- **"Riposo" time**: Sundays and afternoons are rest time. Many shops closed. Italians value work-life balance.
- **Punctuality for social events**: Being 10-15 minutes late ("il quarto d'ora accademico") is acceptable and sometimes expected for social events. For business, be on time.
- **Direct but warm**: Italian communication can be more direct and animated than Anglo cultures, but is accompanied by warmth and expressiveness. Not rudeness.
- **Lei vs. Tu**: This distinction is critical. Using "tu" with strangers/service staff is disrespectful. Wait for "Possiamo darci del tu?" (Can we use tu?)
- **Dress code**: Italians dress elegantly. "Bella figura" (good impression) is important. Neat, stylish clothing valued. Athletic wear is for sports only.
- **"Non c'è problema"**: Italians often say "non c'è problema" (no problem). This is normal, friendly communication.
- **Hand gestures**: Italians use expressive hand gestures in conversation. This is normal communication, not anger or emphasis necessarily.
- **Coffee culture**: Coffee in Italy is espresso. Drink it quickly at bar counter ("al banco"). Cappuccino ONLY for breakfast. Espresso after meals.
- **Bread on table**: Bread is for eating with meal, not for dipping in olive oil (that's American). Use bread to clean plate ("fare la scarpetta").
- **"Passeggiata"**: Evening stroll ("passeggiata") is Italian tradition, especially in smaller towns. People walk, socialize, see and be seen.
- **Family is central**: Italian culture is family-oriented. Sunday lunch with extended family is tradition.
- **Religion**: Italy is historically Catholic. Churches everywhere. Dress modestly when visiting (covered shoulders, no short skirts). Free but donations appreciated.
- **Queue culture**: Italian queuing can be informal. Assert yourself politely at service counters. "Tocca a me" (It's my turn).

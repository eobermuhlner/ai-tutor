Examples:
- "Não falo português" (I don't speak Portuguese)

- "Posso levar isto?" (Can I bring this?)
- "Não entendo" (I don't understand)

### Finding Your Gate and Boarding

Practice locating your gate, asking about boarding time, and understanding boarding announcements.

- "A que horas embarcamos?" (What time do we board?)
- "O voo está atrasado?" (Is the flight delayed?)
- "Onde ficam os banheiros?" (Where are the bathrooms?)

### Immigration and Customs

- "Uma semana" (One week)
- "Duas semanas" (Two weeks)
- "Não tenho nada a declarar" (I have nothing to declare)
- "Onde fica a saída?" (Where is the exit?)

## Practice Patterns

- Successfully check in for a flight and get boarding pass
- Navigate to your gate using only Portuguese directions
- Handle a delayed flight situation and ask for information
- Go through immigration and answer basic questions
- Find baggage claim and report a missing suitcase

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- "Onde é o portão?" → "Onde fica o portão?" (use "fica" for locations, critical for finding gates!)
- "Não falo português" spoken too quietly → Speak clearly - staff need to hear you
- "Meu voo tem atraso" → "Meu voo está atrasado" (more natural phrasing)
- "Pode levar isto?" spoken without "com licença" first → "Com licença, pode levar isto?" (be polite)
- Forgetting gender: "O mala" → "A mala" (suitcase is feminine)
- "Passaporte, por favor" without greeting → Say "Bom dia" or "Boa tarde" first
- Not saying "obrigado/obrigada" → Always thank staff (use -o if you're male, -a if female)

## Cultural Notes

- **Arrive early**: Brazilian airports can have long lines, especially during peak travel seasons. Arrive 3 hours early for international flights.
- **Greetings matter**: Always greet staff with "Bom dia" (good morning), "Boa tarde" (good afternoon), or "Boa noite" (good evening) before making requests.
- **"Com licença" is essential**: Start every question with "Com licença" (excuse me). Not doing so seems rude.
- **Immigration questions**: Be prepared for "Qual o motivo da viagem?" (reason for trip) and "Quanto tempo vai ficar?" (how long staying). "Turismo, uma semana" works fine.
- **Baggage weight**: Limits are enforced but sometimes flexibility exists. Be polite if overweight - "jeitinho brasileiro" may help.
- **Speaking English**: Major airports (GRU, GIG) have English-speaking staff, but attempting Portuguese first shows respect and gets friendlier service.
- **Boarding process**: Boarding may be less organized than in some countries. Listen for your row or zone number.
- **Security is thorough**: Liquid limits (100ml containers), no sharp objects, electronics out. Rules enforced - don't argue.
- **Documents ready**: Keep passport and boarding pass accessible. You'll show them multiple times.
- **Friendly atmosphere**: Brazilian airport staff are generally warm and friendly. Smile and be personable - it goes a long way.

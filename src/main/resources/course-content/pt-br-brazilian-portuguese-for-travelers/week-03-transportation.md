- "Onde eu desço?" (Where do I get off?)
- "Preciso fazer baldeação?" (Do I need to transfer?)

## Practice Patterns

- Successfully purchase a ticket and find your bus/metro
- Ask for and understand transfer instructions
- Take a taxi to your destination
- Navigate using metro maps and signs
- Handle getting on the wrong bus and asking for help

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- "Onde é a estação?" → "Onde fica a estação?" (use "fica" for locations!)
- "Ônibus para..." without "o" → "O ônibus para..." (don't forget articles)
- Trying to pay driver with large bills → Have exact change or small bills ready
- Not saying "obrigado/obrigada" when exiting → Thank the driver when getting off
- Entering through exit door → Enter through front, exit through back/middle doors
- Not offering seat to elderly/pregnant → Offer your seat - it's expected

## Cultural Notes

- **Cash for buses**: Many buses only accept cash or transport cards. Have small bills ready - drivers often don't have change for large bills.
- **Metro cards**: Get a rechargeable transport card immediately in cities like São Paulo or Rio - much cheaper than single tickets.
- **Enter through front**: Board buses through front door, pay driver or scan card. Exit through back or middle doors.
- **Friendly drivers**: Brazilian bus drivers are generally helpful. Don't hesitate to ask for help - they'll often announce your stop.
- **Safety on buses**: Be aware of belongings, especially phones. Keep valuables secure and don't display expensive items.
- **Uber is common**: Uber and similar apps (99, Cabify) are widely used and often safer/cheaper than street taxis in big cities.
- **Traffic and timing**: Brazilian traffic can be unpredictable. Allow extra time for important appointments.
- **No queuing culture**: Boarding can be less organized than in some countries. Be polite but assertive.
- **"Ponto final"**: Final stop. Listen for this if you're unsure where to get off.
- **Friendly help**: Brazilians are very helpful to lost tourists. Ask fellow passengers - they'll often help you reach your destination.

- Master essential anatomical and physiological terminology
- Recognize disease and condition terms
- Apply diagnostic and treatment vocabulary correctly

## Grammar Focus

### Medical Word Formation
**Rule:** Medical terminology follows systematic patterns using Greek and Latin roots with prefixes and suffixes

**Word Structure:** [Prefix] + [Root] + [Suffix]

**Examples:**
- **Hypertension** = Hyper (prefix: excessive) + tens (root: tension) + ion (suffix: condition)
- **Tachycardia** = Tachy (prefix: fast) + card (root: heart) + ia (suffix: condition)
- **Osteoporosis** = Osteo (prefix: bone) + por (root: pore) + osis (suffix: condition)

### Common Prefixes
**Rule:** Prefixes modify the meaning of root words

**Diagnostic Prefixes:**
- **Hyper-** - Excessive, above normal (hypertension - high blood pressure)
- **Hypo-** - Deficient, below normal (hypothyroidism - underactive thyroid)
- **Tachy-** - Fast, rapid (tachycardia - fast heart rate)
- **Brady-** - Slow (bradycardia - slow heart rate)
- **Dys-** - Difficult, painful, abnormal (dyspnea - difficulty breathing)
- **A-/An-** - Without, lack of (anemia - without blood)
- **Anti-** - Against, opposing (antibiotic - against life/bacteria)

**Descriptive Prefixes:**
- **Hemo-/Hema-** - Blood (hemorrhage - bleeding)
- **Myo-** - Muscle (myocardium - heart muscle)

## Conversation Scenarios

### Medical Student Learning
**Instructor:** Can you explain the term "hypertension" by breaking it down into its components?
**Student:** Certainly. "Hyper" means excessive or above normal, "tens" relates to tension or pressure, and the suffix "-ion" indicates a condition. So hypertension is a condition of excessive blood pressure.
**Instructor:** Excellent. Now, how would you break down "tachycardia"?

### Clinical Discussion
**Doctor 1:** The patient presents with dyspnea and chest pain. ECG shows ST elevation.
**Doctor 2:** Likely acute myocardial infarction. We should check cardiac enzymes and prepare for catheterization.
**Doctor 1:** Agreed. I'll order troponin levels and contact cardiology for urgent angioplasty.

## Practice Patterns

- Break down complex medical terms into components
- Identify root words, prefixes, and suffixes
- Practice pronunciation of medical terminology
- Associate terms with body systems and functions

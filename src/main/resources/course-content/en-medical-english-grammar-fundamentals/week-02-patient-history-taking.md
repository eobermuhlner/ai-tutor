## This Week's Goals

- Master chief complaint and history of present illness documentation
- Collect comprehensive past medical, surgical, and family history
- Document social and medication history effectively
- Record allergy information accurately

## Grammar Focus

### Chief Complaint (CC)
**Rule:** The chief complaint is a concise statement in the patient's own words describing the primary reason for the visit

**Format:** "[Patient's exact words], [duration]"

**Examples:**
- "I have had chest pain for three days"
- "I've been coughing up blood for two weeks"
- "My knee has been swollen and painful since yesterday"
- "I feel dizzy when I stand up"

**Documentation Guidelines:**
- Use patient's exact words in quotation marks when possible
- Include onset time and duration
- Be specific about location and character of symptoms
- Avoid medical jargon in initial documentation

### History of Present Illness (HPI)
**Rule:** HPI is a chronological account of the patient's current condition using the OLDCARTS mnemonic for symptom characterization

**OLDCARTS Mnemonic:**
- **O**nset - When did it start?
- **L**ocation - Where is it located?
- **D**uration - How long does it last?
- **C**haracter - What does it feel like?
- **A**ggravating factors - What makes it worse?
- **R**elieving factors - What makes it better?
- **T**iming - When does it occur?
- **S**everity - How severe is it?

**Example HPI for Chest Pain:**
"The patient is a 58-year-old male who presents with sudden onset chest pain that began three hours ago while climbing stairs. The pain is substernal, crushing, and radiates to his left arm and jaw. It is constant and rated 8/10 in severity. The pain is not relieved by rest or nitroglycerin, which he took at home. He denies associated shortness of breath, nausea, or diaphoresis. The pain is exacerbated by exertion."

- "PMH: Surgery" → "PMH: Appendectomy 2018 for appendicitis" (include specifics)
- "FH: Heart disease" → "FH: Father-MI age 62" (be specific with relationship and age)

- "MedHx: Pills" → "MedHx: Lisinopril 10mg daily, Metformin 500mg twice daily" (include specific medications)
- "Allergies: Drugs" → "Allergies: Penicillin-anaphylaxis age 12" (be specific with reactions)
- "**Review of systems:** Negative except as noted in HPI" ✓ (correct ROS documentation)

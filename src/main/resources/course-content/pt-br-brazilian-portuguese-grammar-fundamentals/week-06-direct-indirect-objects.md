## Grammar Focus

### Direct Object Pronouns (Pronomes Objeto Direto)

**Rule:** Direct object pronouns replace direct objects (what/whom the action is done to).

**Portuguese Direct Object Pronouns:**
- **me** - me (me)
- **te** - you (you)
- **o** - him/it (masculine) or you (formal singular)
- **a** - her/it (feminine) or you (formal singular)
- **nos** - us (us)
- **vos** - you (plural formal/informal - rarely used in Brazil)
- **os** - them (masculine) or you (plural formal)
- **as** - them (feminine) or you (plural formal)

### Direct Object Pronoun Placement

**Rule:** Place direct object pronouns before conjugated verbs or attach them to infinitives/gerunds/imperatives.

**Before Conjugated Verbs:**
- **Eu o vejo** (I see him/it)
- **Você a conhece** (You know her)

**Attached to Infinitives:**
- **Quero vê-lo** (I want to see him)
- **Vou comprá-la** (I'm going to buy it)

**Attached to Gerunds:**
- **Estou lendo-o** (I'm reading it)
- **Continuo vendo-a** (I continue seeing her)

**With Imperatives:**
- **Veja-o!** (See it!)
- **Dê-a para mim!** (Give it to me!)

### Complete Direct Object Pronoun Table

| Person | Masculine Singular | Feminine Singular | Masculine Plural | Feminine Plural |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| 1st Sing. | me | me | nos | nos |
| 2nd Sing. | te | te | vos | vos |
| 3rd Sing. | o | a | os | as |
| 2nd Form. | o | a | os | as |
| 3rd Plural | os | as | os | as |

### Indirect Object Pronouns (Pronomes Objeto Indireto)

**Rule:** Indirect object pronouns indicate to whom or for whom the action is done.

**Portuguese Indirect Object Pronouns:**
- **me** - to/for me
- **te** - to/for you (informal)
- **lhe** - to/for him/her/you (formal)
- **nos** - to/for us
- **vos** - to/for you (plural formal/informal - rarely used in Brazil)
- **lhes** - to/for them/you (plural formal)

### Indirect Object Pronoun Placement

**Rule:** Indirect object pronouns follow the same placement rules as direct object pronouns.

**Before Conjugated Verbs:**
- **Eu lhe dou o livro** (I give him the book) → **Eu lho dou** (I give it to him)
- **Você nos ajuda** (You help us)

**Attached to Infinitives:**
- **Quero falar-lhe** (I want to talk to him/her)
- **Vou enviá-lo-lhe** (I'm going to send it to him/her)

**Attached to Gerunds:**
- **Estou falando-lhe** (I'm talking to him/her)
- **Continuo ajudando-os** (I continue helping them)

**With Imperatives:**
- **Fale-lhe!** (Talk to him/her!)
- **Dê-mo!** (Give it to me!)

### Complete Indirect Object Pronoun Table

| Person | Singular | Plural |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1st | me (to/for me) | nos (to/for us) |
| 2nd | te (to/for you) | vos (to/for you - Brazil rarely used) |
| 3rd/Formal | lhe (to/for him/her/you) | lhes (to/for them/you plural) |

### Combining Direct and Indirect Object Pronouns

**Rule:** When using both direct and indirect object pronouns, follow specific ordering rules.

**Normal Combination:**
- **Eu lhe dou o livro** (I give him the book) → **Eu lho dou** (I give it to him)
- **Eu me lavo as mãos** (I wash my hands) → **Eu mas lavo** (I wash them)

**Order Rule:** Indirect pronoun + Direct pronoun
- **me + o = mo**
- **te + a = ta**
- **lhe + os = lhos**
- **nos + as = nas**
- **vos + os = vos** (rarely used in Brazil)

### Special Combination Rules

**Rule:** Some combinations have special contracted forms.

**Common Contractions:**
- **me + o = mo**
- **me + a = ma**
- **te + o = to**
- **te + a = ta**
- **se + o = so**
- **se + a = sa**
- **nos + o = no**
- **nos + a = na**
- **vos + o = vo** (Brazil: rarely used)
- **vos + a = va** (Brazil: rarely used)

**Examples:**
- **Eu mo dou** (I give it to him - but rarely used in modern Brazilian Portuguese)
- **Eu lho dou** (I give it to him/her)
- **Eu lha dou** (I give it to her)

**Modern Brazilian Usage:**
Many of these contracted forms are rarely used in modern Brazilian Portuguese. Instead, speakers often use the full pronouns:
- **Eu lhe dou o livro** (I give him the book) rather than **Eu lho dou**

### Object Pronouns with Infinitives and Gerunds

**Rule:** Object pronouns can be attached to the end of infinitives and gerunds with hyphens when necessary.

**Infinitive + Pronouns:**
- **Vou comprá-lo** (I'm going to buy it)
- **Decidi convidá-los** (I decided to invite them)
- **Vou vê-la amanhã** (I'm going to see her tomorrow)

**Gerund + Pronouns:**
- **Estou lendo-o** (I'm reading it)
- **Continuo ajudando-os** (I continue helping them)
- **Fico pensando nisso** (I keep thinking about that)

**Imperative + Pronouns:**
- **Dê-o para mim!** (Give it to me!)
- **Traga-a amanhã!** (Bring it tomorrow!)
- **Fale com eles!** (Speak with them!)

### Special Considerations

**Rule:** Some special rules apply to object pronoun usage.

**Position with Negative Sentences:**
Place "não" before the object pronoun.
- **Não o vejo** (I don't see him)
- **Não lhe dou atenção** (I don't pay attention to him/her)

**Position with Question Forms:**
- **Você o viu?** (Did you see him?)
- **Onde a colocou?** (Where did you put it?)

**With "todo" and indefinite expressions:**
- **Todo-o** (all of it) → **Todo ele** (All of it)
- **Algum-o** (some of it) → **Algum dele** (Some of it)

### Demonstrative Examples

**Rule:** Object pronouns in context.

**Daily Situations:**
- **Você viu o filme? Sim, eu o vi ontem** (Did you see the movie? Yes, I saw it yesterday)
- **Você escreveu para seus pais? Sim, eu lhes escrevi semana passada** (Did you write to your parents? Yes, I wrote to them last week)
- **Me trouxe os documentos? Sim, eu te os trouxe** (Did you bring me the documents? Yes, I brought them to you)

**Professional Context:**
- **Você enviou o relatório ao diretor? Sim, eu lho enviei** (Did you send the report to the director? Yes, I sent it to him)
- **Eles receberam as informações? Sim, nós lhes demos** (Did they receive the information? Yes, we gave it to them)

**Social Interaction:**
- **Você se encontrou com Maria? Sim, eu a encontrei no parque** (Did you meet Maria? Yes, I met her in the park)
- **Você apresentou os amigos? Sim, eu os apresentei** (Did you introduce the friends? Yes, I introduced them)

**Negative form:** Não o vi (I didn't see him) / Não lhes escrevi (I didn't write to them)
**Question form:** Você o viu? (Did you see him?) / Onde a colocou? (Where did you put it?)

## Conversation Scenarios

### Using Object Pronouns in Daily Context

Practice using direct and indirect object pronouns when talking about giving, receiving, and doing things for others.

Key grammar to practice:
- **Você viu o filme? Sim, eu o vi** (Did you see the movie? Yes, I saw it)
- **Você escreveu para seus pais? Sim, eu lhes escrevi** (Did you write to your parents? Yes, I wrote to them)
- **Me trouxe os documentos? Sim, eu te os trouxe** (Did you bring me the documents? Yes, I brought them to you)
- **Eu lho dei** (I gave it to him/her)

## Practice Patterns

- Replace nouns with appropriate object pronouns
- Place object pronouns correctly in sentences
- Combine direct and indirect object pronouns
- Use object pronouns with infinitives and gerunds
- Distinguish between formal and informal usage contexts

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- **Eu o vi ele** → **Eu o vi** (unnecessary redundancy)
- **Lhe dou o livro** → **Eu lho dou** (incorrect order)
- **Estou lê-lo** → **Estou lendo-o** (wrong gerund form)
- **Dê-me ele** → **Dê-mo** (wrong pronoun usage)
- **Não vi ele** → **Não o vi** (should use pronoun)
- **Vi ela ontem** → **A vi ontem** (wrong pronoun order)

## Cultural Notes

In Portuguese, the use of direct and indirect object pronouns is essential for clear communication and is more flexible than in English. The placement of these pronouns is more varied than in English, allowing for emphasis or stylistic variation. In Brazilian Portuguese, many of the contracted pronoun forms (mo, to, lho) are rarely used in modern speech, with speakers preferring the full pronoun forms (me o, te a, lhe o). Understanding and correctly using object pronouns helps avoid ambiguity in Portuguese, where subject pronouns are often omitted.

## Grammar Focus

### Formal vs. Informal Address (Sie vs. Du)

**Rule:** Use "Sie" (formal you) with strangers, elders, colleagues, and service staff. Use "du" (informal you) only with friends, family, and children. When in doubt, always use Sie.

Examples:
- Formal: "Wie heißen Sie?" (What's your name? - formal)
- Informal: "Wie heißt du?" (What's your name - informal)
- Formal: "Können Sie mir helfen?" (Can you help me? - formal)
- Informal: "Kannst du mir helfen?" (Can you help me? - informal)

### Polite Requests and Expressions

**Rule:** Use "bitte" (please) frequently and "Entschuldigung" (excuse me) when interrupting. These are essential for German politeness.

Examples:

## Practice Patterns

- Greet people appropriately in formal and informal contexts
- Navigate a social situation determining when to use Sie vs. du
- Follow German dining etiquette at a restaurant
- Apologize appropriately for a mistake or inconvenience
- Thank someone formally for their help or hospitality

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- Using "du" with strangers or elders → Always use "Sie" until invited to use "du" (major cultural error!)
- "Wie sind Sie?" → "Wie geht es Ihnen?" (wrong verb - use "gehen" for "how are you")
- Forgetting to say "Guten Tag" when entering shops → ALWAYS greet (basic German courtesy!)
- Saying "Danke" without "bitte" response → When someone thanks you, respond "bitte" or "gern geschehen"
- Not making eye contact when toasting → Always make eye contact when saying "Prost!" (important cultural rule)
- Being late without calling → Germans value punctuality - always call if running late
- "Entschuldigen Sie" → "Entschuldigung" or "Entschuldigen Sie mich" (correct form)
- Speaking too loudly in public → Germans speak more quietly than Americans - match their volume

## Cultural Notes

- **Punctuality is sacred**: Germans take punctuality very seriously. Being even 5 minutes late is considered rude unless you call ahead. "5 vor 12" (5 to 12) means exactly 11:55, not "around noon."
- **Sie vs. du is critical**: This distinction is FUNDAMENTAL in German culture. Using "du" with strangers, elders, or service staff is very rude. Wait for the other person to suggest "du" - don't assume.
- **Formal greetings required**: Always say "Guten Tag" or "Guten Morgen" when entering shops, offices, elevators with people. Not greeting is considered extremely rude.
- **Handshake culture**: Germans shake hands when meeting (both first time and regular greetings in professional settings). Firm handshake, eye contact, and "Freut mich" (pleased to meet you).
- **No hugging or touching**: Germans maintain more personal space than Americans. Hugs and cheek kisses are only for close friends/family. Don't touch people you just met.
- **Direct communication**: Germans value honesty and directness. "No" means no - they don't soften refusals like English speakers often do. This isn't rudeness, it's clarity.
- **Privacy is valued**: Germans don't typically ask personal questions (salary, religion, politics) until they know you well. Small talk is less common than in English-speaking cultures.
- **"Bitte" and "Danke" are essential**: Use "bitte" (please) and "danke" (thank you) constantly. More than in English. Germans notice and appreciate politeness.
- **Table manners**: Keep hands on table (not in lap), don't start eating until everyone has food, say "Guten Appetit" before eating. Finish everything on your plate - leaving food suggests it wasn't good.
- **Toasting customs**: Make direct eye contact with each person when saying "Prost!" or "Zum Wohl!" Not making eye contact is bad luck (and rude).
- **Tipping customs**: Service charge is included in German bills. Additional tipping is optional but appreciated - round up or add 5-10%. Say "Stimmt so" (keep the change) when paying.
- **Noise levels**: Germans value quiet, especially in residential areas. "Ruhezeit" (quiet hours) are 10pm-6am and Sunday afternoons. No loud music, vacuuming, or construction during these times.
- **Sunday closures**: Most stores closed on Sundays. This is family/rest day. Germans take it seriously - plan shopping for weekdays/Saturday.
- **"Mahlzeit" greeting**: Around lunchtime (11am-2pm), Germans greet each other with "Mahlzeit!" (meal time). It's a common workplace greeting during lunch hours.
- **Coffee and cake tradition**: "Kaffee und Kuchen" (coffee and cake) is a German tradition, usually around 3-4pm on weekends. Similar to British afternoon tea.
- **Gift giving**: If invited to a German home, bring flowers (unwrap before giving), wine, or chocolates. Avoid red roses (romantic) and even-numbered flowers (for funerals).
- **Dress code**: Germans dress more formally than Americans. Business casual is common for work. Athletic wear is for sports only, not casual everyday wear.
- **"Feierabend" concept**: "Feierabend" (end of work day) is sacred. Germans typically don't work late or answer work calls after hours. Work-life balance is highly valued.
- **Environmental consciousness**: Germans are very environmentally conscious. Recycling is mandatory and detailed (paper, glass by color, plastic, bio-waste). Learn the system.
- **Bureaucracy and rules**: Germans follow rules strictly. Jaywalking, littering, or ignoring regulations is frowned upon. When in doubt, follow the rules.
- **Beer culture**: Beer is part of German culture. Legal to drink in public. "Prost!" is the standard toast. Many regional beer varieties - each area proud of its local breweries.
- **Carnival/Fasching**: In some regions (especially Rhineland and Southern Germany), Carnival (Fasching/Karneval) before Lent is a major celebration with parades, costumes, and partying.

## This Week's Goals

- Review and consolidate all major grammar points covered in the course
- Practice integrating multiple grammar concepts in complex sentences
- Identify and correct common grammatical errors
- Develop confidence in using grammar structures in context

## Grammar Focus

### Comprehensive Grammar Integration

**Rule:** Combine multiple grammar concepts learned throughout the course to form complex, nuanced sentences.

Examples integrating multiple concepts:
- **Tenses + Modals:** "I **must have been studying** all night" (modal + perfect + continuous)
- **Conditionals + Passive:** "If I **had been invited**, I **would have attended** (passive in both clauses)
- **Pronouns + Prepositions:** "He **is proud of himself**" (reflexive pronoun + preposition)

### Complex Sentence Structures

**Rule:** Combine simple clauses using coordinating and subordinating conjunctions to form complex sentences.

Examples:
- **Compound:** I studied hard, **and** I passed the exam
- **Complex:** Although I was tired, I continued working
- **Compound-complex:** I studied hard, **but** I was still nervous **because** the exam was difficult

### Complete Grammar Review Table

| Grammar Point | Structure | Example | Error to Avoid |
|---------------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Present Tense | Subject + base verb (+s for 3rd person) | She **works** daily | She work (no -s) |
| Past Tense | Subject + past form | I **visited** yesterday | I visiteded (wrong past) |
| Future Tense | Subject + will + base verb | I **will go** tomorrow | I will goes (no -s) |
| Articles | A/An/The + noun | **A book** / **The book** | I have book (missing article) |
| Comparatives | More/more + adj. or adj. + -er | More beautiful / Taller | More taller (double comparative) |
| Prepositions | Verb + preposition | Go **to** school | Go in school (wrong preposition) |
| Pronouns | Subject/Object forms | **She** knows **me** | She knows I (wrong object) |
| Modals | Modal + base verb | I **can** swim | I can to swim (no "to") |
| Conditionals | If-clause + main clause | If I study, I will pass | If I will study (wrong if-clause) |
| Passive | Be + past participle | The book **was written** | The book was wrote (wrong participle) |

### Advanced Grammar Patterns

**Rule:** Use advanced constructions for more sophisticated expression.

Examples:
- **Perfect tenses:** I have **already eaten** / I had **finished** before you came
- **Continuous tenses:** I **am studying** now / I **was sleeping** when you called
- **Relative clauses:** The man **who** called is my friend / The book **that** I read was good
- **Gerunds and infinitives:** I enjoy **reading** / I want **to travel**

**Negative form:** I have not finished the work yet. / The letter was not sent.
**Question form:** Have you finished the work? / Where was the letter sent?

## Essential Vocabulary

### Supporting Vocabulary
- **syntax** - arrangement of words and phrases
- **morphology** - form and structure of words
- **agreement** - matching between subject and verb, noun and adjective
- **coherence** - logical connection between ideas

### Grammar Review Terms
- **Simple sentence:** Contains one independent clause
- **Compound sentence:** Contains two or more independent clauses
- **Complex sentence:** Contains one independent and one or more dependent clauses
- **Compound-complex:** Multiple independent and dependent clauses

### Advanced Constructions
- **Subjunctive mood:** If I **were** rich (unreal condition)
- **Causative:** I had my car **repaired**
- **Ellipsis:** I like coffee, **and** (I like) tea (understood verb)

## Conversation Scenarios

### Integrating All Grammar Concepts

Practice using a combination of all grammar concepts learned in the course when engaging in more complex conversations and discussions.

Key grammar to practice:
- "If I had studied harder, I might have been more successful" (complex conditional with modal)
- "I am proud of myself for completing the work that was assigned" (reflexive + relative clause)
- "The book that I had bought was more expensive than I expected" (relative + past perfect)

## Practice Patterns

- Create complex sentences combining multiple grammar concepts
- Identify all grammar points used in complex sentences
- Correct sentences containing multiple errors
- Transform simple sentences into compound or complex sentences
- Practice advanced structures like relative clauses and perfect tenses

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- **Tense consistency:** "I study and studied well" → "I studied well" (same time reference)
- **Subject-verb agreement:** "She go to school" → "She goes to school" (third person -s)
- **Preposition errors:** "I am good in tennis" → "I am good at tennis" (wrong preposition)
- **Modal + perfect:** "I must to have done it" → "I must have done it" (no "to" after modals)
- **Double negatives:** "I don't need no help" → "I don't need any help" (standard English)

## Cultural Notes

In American English, speakers often use compound sentences more frequently than complex sentences in casual speech. However, in formal writing and academic contexts, complex and compound-complex sentences are preferred for expressing nuanced ideas. Americans also tend to use contractions (I'm, you're, we've) more frequently than speakers of other English varieties in informal contexts.

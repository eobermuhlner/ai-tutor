## Conversation Scenarios

### Discussing Time and Location

Practice using prepositions correctly when talking about time, location, and direction in everyday conversations.

Key grammar to practice:
- "I will meet you at the library at 3 PM" (time and place)
- "The book is on the table next to the computer" (location)
- "She walked from the car into the building" (direction)
- "The cat is under the table" (position)

## Practice Patterns

- Choose the correct preposition for time expressions
- Identify appropriate prepositions for spatial relationships
- Form sentences using prepositions of direction
- Create sentences with common prepositional phrases
- Complete gaps with the correct preposition

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- "I will meet you in 3 PM" → "I will meet you at 3 PM" (wrong time preposition)
- "I live in New York Street" → "I live on New York Street" (wrong place preposition)
- "I'm good to tennis" → "I'm good at tennis" (wrong preposition with adjective)
- "I go to school with bus" → "I go to school by bus" (wrong transportation preposition)
- "She arrived to the airport" → "She arrived at the airport" (wrong arrival preposition)

## Cultural Notes

In American English, there are some preposition differences from British English: Americans say "on the weekend" while British say "at the weekend." Americans also often omit prepositions where British English includes them: "I'll see you next week" vs. British "I'll see you on Friday next."

## This Week's Goals

- Learn proper placement of adjectives in sentences
- Master comparative and superlative forms of adjectives and adverbs
- Understand adverb formation from adjectives
- Use degrees of comparison accurately

## Grammar Focus

### Adjective Position

**Rule:** Adjectives typically come before the noun they modify in English.

Examples:
- **A red car** is parked outside
- I bought **three expensive books**
- She has **a beautiful house**

Exception: Some adjectives come after linking verbs (be, seem, appear)
- The car **is red**
- The books **are expensive**

### Comparative and Superlative Forms

**Rule:** Form comparatives with -er/more and superlatives with -est/most.

Regular adjectives:
- Short (1-2 syllables): tall → taller → tallest
- Long (3+ syllables): beautiful → more beautiful → most beautiful

Examples:
- Comparative: She is **taller** than her sister
- Superlative: She is **the tallest** in her family
- Long adjectives: He is **more careful** than before / **the most careful** student

### Irregular Comparatives and Superlatives

| Adjective | Comparative | Superlative |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| good/well | better | best |
| bad | worse | worst |
| far | farther/further | farthest/furthest |
| little | less | least |
| much/many | more | most |
| old | older/elder | oldest/eldest |

### Adverb Formation

**Rule:** Most adverbs are formed by adding -ly to adjectives.

Examples:
- Quick → quickly: He runs **quickly**
- Careful → carefully: Drive **carefully**
- Special → especially: This is **especially** important

Irregular adverbs:
- Good → well: He runs **well**
- Fast → fast: He runs **fast** (both adjective and adverb)
- Hard → hard: Work **hard**

### Complete Comparison Table

| Adjective | Comparative | Superlative | Example (Comparative) |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|
| tall | taller | tallest | He is taller than me |
| happy | happier | happiest | She is the happiest |
| beautiful | more beautiful | most beautiful | She is more beautiful |
| expensive | more expensive | most expensive | This is most expensive |
| good | better | best | He is better at math |

**Negative form:** He is not taller than his brother. / The task is not difficult.
**Question form:** Is she taller than her sister? / Is this the best option?

## Conversation Scenarios

### Describing and Comparing Things

Practice comparing people, places, and things using proper comparative and superlative forms, and describing actions with appropriate adverbs.

Key grammar to practice:
- "This book is more interesting than that one" (comparative)
- "She runs faster than I do" (adverb comparative)
- "He speaks English very well" (adverb)
- "This is the most beautiful place I've seen" (superlative)

## Practice Patterns

- Convert adjectives to adverbs
- Form comparative and superlative sentences
- Identify correct adjective position in sentences
- Distinguish between adjectives and adverbs in context
- Create sentences using irregular comparatives and superlatives

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- "She is more taller" → "She is taller" (double comparative)
- "He runs good" → "He runs well" (use adverb with verbs)
- "She sings beautiful" → "She sings beautifully" (use adverb to describe action)
- "He is the most tallest" → "He is the tallest" (double superlative)
- "The weather is more better" → "The weather is better" (wrong comparative form)

## Cultural Notes

In informal American English, double comparatives like "more better" are sometimes used in casual speech, but they are grammatically incorrect. Also, Americans often use "more" instead of irregular comparatives in casual speech: "more good" instead of "better," though this is non-standard.

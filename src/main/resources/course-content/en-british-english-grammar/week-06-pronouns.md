## This Week's Goals

- Master personal pronouns in subject and object forms
- Use possessive pronouns correctly (my/mine, your/yours, etc.)
- Understand and use demonstrative pronouns (this/that/these/those)
- Learn reflexive pronouns and their proper usage

## Grammar Focus

### Personal Pronouns

**Rule:** Subject pronouns come before the verb; object pronouns come after verbs or prepositions.

Subject pronouns: I, you, he, she, it, we, they
Object pronouns: me, you, him, her, it, us, them

Examples:
- **Subject:** **I** work here. **She** sings beautifully.
- **Object:** The teacher knows **me**. I like **her** very much.

### Complete Personal Pronoun Table

| Person | Subject | Object | Example (Subject) | Example (Object) |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1st Sing. | I | me | **I** study | Give it to **me** |
| 2nd Sing. | you | you | **You** work | I know **you** |
| 3rd Sing. M | he | him | **He** runs | I see **him** |
| 3rd Sing. F | she | her | **She** works | I help **her** |
| 3rd Sing. N | it | it | **It** flies | I bought **it** |
| 1st Plural | we | us | **We** play | Call **us** |
| 2nd Plural | you | you | **You** study | We met **you** |
| 3rd Plural | they | them | **They** run | I know **them** |

### Possessive Pronouns

**Rule:** Use "my, your, his, her, its, our, their" before nouns; use "mine, yours, his, hers, ours, theirs" without nouns.

Examples:
- **With noun:** This is **my** car. Those are **their** books.
- **Without noun:** The car is **mine**. The books are **theirs**.

### Demonstrative Pronouns

**Rule:** "This/these" for things near you; "that/those" for things farther away.

Examples:
- **Near:** **This** is my pen. **These** are my books.
- **Far:** **That** is my car. **Those** are my friends.

### Reflexive Pronouns

**Rule:** Use reflexive pronouns when the subject and object are the same person/thing.

Examples:
- I hurt **myself**. She bought **herself** a gift.
- We taught **ourselves**. They enjoy **themselves**.

### Complete Reflexive Pronoun Table

| Personal Pronoun | Reflexive Pronoun | Example |
|------------------|-------------------|---------|
| I | myself | I see **myself** |
| you | yourself/yourselves | See **yourself** |
| he | himself | He hurt **himself** |
| she | herself | She dressed **herself** |
| it | itself | The cat cleaned **itself** |
| we | ourselves | We helped **ourselves** |
| they | themselves | They taught **themselves** |

**Negative form:** I don't know him. / Myself, I don't agree.
**Question form:** Do you know him? / Who is that? / What is this?

## Essential Vocabulary

### Supporting Vocabulary
- **pronoun** - word replacing a noun
- **subject** - who performs the action
- **object** - who receives the action
- **reflexive** - referring back to the subject

### Possessive Adjectives vs Pronouns
- **Adjectives:** my, your, his, her, its, our, their
- **Pronouns:** mine, yours, his, hers, ours, theirs

### Demonstratives
- **Singular near:** this, that
- **Plural near:** these, those

## Conversation Scenarios

### Using Pronouns in Daily Communication

Practice replacing nouns with appropriate pronouns in conversations to make speech more natural and efficient.

Key grammar to practice:
- "Where is John? I don't see him" (object pronoun)
- "This is my book and that one is yours" (demonstrative and possessive)
- "I hurt myself while cooking" (reflexive pronoun)
- "These are our friends and those are theirs" (demonstrative and possessive)

## Practice Patterns

- Replace nouns with appropriate personal pronouns
- Choose between possessive adjectives and pronouns
- Use demonstrative pronouns correctly based on distance
- Form sentences with reflexive pronouns
- Identify correct pronoun case (subject vs object)

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- "Me and John went" → "John and I went" (wrong subject pronoun)
- "Give it to she" → "Give it to her" (wrong object pronoun)
- "This are my books" → "These are my books" (number agreement)
- "I bought a present for I" → "I bought a present for me" (wrong case)
- "He and myself went" → "He and I went" or "He went with me" (reflexive misused)

## Cultural Notes

In British English, "myself" is sometimes used more frequently than in American English for emphasis or formality: "I myself don't agree" instead of simply "I don't agree." Also, informal British speech sometimes uses "myself" and "yourself" forms where American English would use simple object pronouns: "I'll do it myself" vs. American "I'll do it."

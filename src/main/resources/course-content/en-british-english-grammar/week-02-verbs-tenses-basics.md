## This Week's Goals

- Master the basic forms of present, past, and future tenses
- Understand the difference between regular and irregular verbs
- Learn to form simple sentences using different verb tenses
- Practice using time indicators with each tense

## Grammar Focus

### Present Tense

**Rule:** For regular verbs, the present tense uses the base form of the verb. For third person singular, add -s or -es.

Examples:
- I/You/We/They **work** every day
- He/She/It **works** every day
- He **goes** to school daily

### Past Tense

**Rule:** For regular verbs, add -ed to the base form. Irregular verbs have special forms that must be memorized.

Examples:
- Regular: I **worked**, You **played**, They **visited**
- Irregular: I **went**, You **ate**, He **saw**, She **wrote**

### Future Tense

**Rule:** Form future tense using auxiliary "will" + base form of the verb.

Examples:
- I **will go** to the park tomorrow
- She **will study** for her exam next week
- They **will travel** to Europe next month

## Conversation Scenarios

### Using Verb Tenses in Daily Life

Practice forming sentences about your daily routine, past experiences, and future plans using appropriate verb tenses.

Key grammar to practice:
- "I usually work at the office" (present)
- "Yesterday I visited my friend" (past)
- "Tomorrow I will go shopping" (future)
- "I am going to call my mother" (future intention)

## Practice Patterns

- Conjugate regular verbs in all three tenses for all pronouns
- Rewrite irregular verb sentences in different tenses
- Transform present tense sentences to past and future
- Complete sentences with the correct verb tense
- Create sentences using time indicators with each tense

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- "I goed to school" → "I went to school" (wrong past tense of irregular verb)
- "He don't work here" → "He doesn't work here" (wrong third person singular negative)
- "She will goes to the store" → "She will go to the store" (future tense doesn't add -s)
- "I was went to the park" → "I went to the park" (mixed past tense forms)
- "I work yesterday" → "I worked yesterday" (wrong tense for time reference)

## Cultural Notes

In British English, the present perfect tense is more commonly used than in American English for recent events, even with specific time markers: "I have already eaten" rather than "I already ate" when referring to today's meal.

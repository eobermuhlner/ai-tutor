## This Week's Goals

- Master the structure and use of zero conditional for general truths
- Learn first conditional for real future possibilities
- Understand second conditional for unreal present situations
- Begin third conditional for unreal past situations

## Grammar Focus

### Zero Conditional

**Rule:** Use present simple in both clauses for scientific facts or general truths.

Structure: If + present simple, present simple

Examples:
- If you heat ice, it melts
- If it rains, the ground gets wet
- When I'm tired, I sleep

### First Conditional

**Rule:** Use present simple in if-clause and will + base verb in main clause for real future possibilities.

Structure: If + present simple, will + base verb

Examples:
- If it rains tomorrow, I will stay home
- I will call you if I have time
- If you study hard, you will pass the exam

### Second Conditional

**Rule:** Use past simple in if-clause and would + base verb in main clause for unreal present situations.

Structure: If + past simple, would + base verb

Examples:
- If I had more money, I would travel the world
- I would be happy if I won the lottery
- If I were you, I would take that job

Note: Use "were" for all subjects in second conditional (formal) or "was" informally.

### Complete Conditional Reference Table

| Type | If-Clause (Condition) | Main Clause (Result) | Use | Example |
|------|----------------------|---------------------|-----|---------|
| Zero | Present Simple | Present Simple | General truth | If you mix oil and water, they separate |
| First | Present Simple | Will + Base Verb | Real future | If I have time, I will help you |
| Second | Past Simple | Would + Base Verb | Unreal present | If I were rich, I would buy a yacht |
| Third | Past Perfect | Would have + Past Participle | Unreal past | If I had studied, I would have passed |

### Third Conditional (Basic)

**Rule:** Use past perfect in if-clause and would have + past participle in main clause for unreal past situations.

Structure: If + past perfect, would have + past participle

Examples:
- If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam
- I would have called you if I had known your number

### Mixed Conditionals

**Rule:** Combine different conditional structures for complex time situations.

Examples:
- If I had won the lottery (past), I would be rich now (present)
- If I were rich now (present), I would have bought a car (past ability)

**Negative form:** If I didn't work here, I wouldn't know him. / If I had studied, I wouldn't have failed.
**Question form:** What would you do if you won the lottery? / Would you go if you were invited?

## Essential Vocabulary

### Supporting Vocabulary
- **conditional** - expressing a condition or dependency
- **clause** - part of a sentence containing subject and verb
- **subjunctive** - mood expressing what is hypothetical
- **counterfactual** - contrary to fact

### Conditional Connectors
- **If:** If it rains, we'll stay inside
- **Unless:** Unless you hurry, you'll be late (meaning "if not")
- **As long as:** I'll help as long as you need
- **Provided that:** You can borrow my car provided that you return it

## Conversation Scenarios

### Hypothetical Situations and Possibilities

Practice forming conditional sentences when discussing possibilities, making plans, and talking about unreal situations in everyday contexts.

Key grammar to practice:
- "If I have time, I will visit you" (first conditional)
- "If I were taller, I would play basketball" (second conditional)
- "If I had known, I would have helped" (third conditional)
- "What would you do if you won a million dollars?" (hypothetical)

## Practice Patterns

- Complete conditional sentences with correct verb forms
- Identify which conditional type is being used
- Transform sentences from one conditional type to another
- Create conditional sentences based on given situations
- Distinguish between real and unreal conditional situations

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- "If I will go, I will call you" → "If I go, I will call you" (don't use will in if-clause)
- "If I would study, I would pass" → "If I studied, I would pass" (wrong second conditional)
- "If I was you" → "If I were you" (subjunctive form)
- "If I would have known" → "If I had known" (wrong third conditional)
- "If I will have time" → "If I have time" (don't use will in if-clause)

## Cultural Notes

British English often uses "if I were" in second conditional more consistently than American English, which sometimes accepts "if I was." Also, British English sometimes uses "would" in if-clauses in reported speech contexts: "He said he would help if I were to ask him."

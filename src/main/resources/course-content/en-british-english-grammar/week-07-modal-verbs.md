## Conversation Scenarios

### Expressing Ability, Permission, and Obligation

Practice using modal verbs appropriately when discussing ability, making requests, giving advice, and expressing necessity in daily interactions.

Key grammar to practice:
- "I can speak English" (ability)
- "May I borrow your pen?" (formal permission)
- "You should see a doctor" (advice)
- "I must finish this project by Friday" (obligation)

## Practice Patterns

- Form sentences expressing ability, permission, and obligation
- Create questions and negatives with modal verbs
- Identify appropriate modal for different contexts
- Distinguish between similar modals (can vs may for permission)
- Rewrite sentences using different modal verbs

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- "I can to swim" → "I can swim" (modal verbs don't use "to")
- "She cans swim" → "She can swim" (modals don't add -s)
- "Can I may use your phone?" → "May I use your phone?" (two modals together)
- "He musts go now" → "He must go now" (modals don't add -s)
- "I should must go" → "I should go" or "I must go" (don't combine modals)

## Cultural Notes

In British English, "may" is more commonly used for permission than in American English ("May I go?" vs. American "Can I go?"). Also, British English often uses "shall" with first person for future questions: "Shall we go?" instead of "Should we go?" or "Will we go?" which Americans would prefer.

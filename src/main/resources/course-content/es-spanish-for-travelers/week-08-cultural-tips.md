## Grammar Focus

### Formal vs. Informal Address

**Rule:** Use "tú" (informal you) with friends, peers, and young people. Use "usted" (formal you) with strangers, elders, and professional contexts. When in doubt, start formal.

Examples:
- Informal: "¿Cómo estás?" (How are you? - to friends)
- Formal: "¿Cómo está usted?" (How are you? - to strangers/elders)
- Informal: "¿Puedes ayudarme?" (Can you help me? - to friend)
- Formal: "¿Puede ayudarme?" (Can you help me? - to stranger)

### Polite Requests and Expressions

**Rule:** Use "por favor" (please), "gracias" (thank you), and "de nada" (you're welcome) frequently. Use "Quisiera..." (I would like...) for polite requests.

Examples:
- "Quisiera un café, por favor" (I would like a coffee, please)

## Conversation Scenarios

- "La ciudad es muy bonita" (The city is very beautiful)

### Dining Out with Cultural Awareness

Practice ordering food, understanding meal timing, and following dining etiquette in Spanish-speaking countries.

Key phrases:
- "¿A qué hora abren?" (What time do you open?)
- "¿Tienen menú del día?" (Do you have a set menu?)
- "Buen provecho" (Enjoy your meal - said to others)
- "La cuenta, por favor" (The bill, please)
- "¿Está incluida la propina?" (Is the tip included?)

### Greeting People Appropriately

Practice formal and informal greetings, understanding when to use tú vs. usted, and following local greeting customs.

Key phrases:
- "Buenos días, ¿cómo está?" (Good morning, how are you? - formal)
- "Mucho gusto en conocerlo" (Nice to meet you - formal)

### Attending Social Events

Practice navigating parties, gatherings, or business events with appropriate social behavior and conversation.

- "¿Puedo traer algo?" (Can I bring something?)
- "¡Salud!" (Cheers! - when toasting)
- "Fue un placer" (It was a pleasure)
- "Hasta pronto" (See you soon)

## Practice Patterns

- Navigate a formal introduction and determine when to switch from usted to tú
- Order dinner at a restaurant following local meal timing and etiquette
- Make appropriate small talk without asking culturally inappropriate questions
- Attend a social gathering and use proper greetings and farewells
- Handle a situation where you unintentionally violated a cultural norm

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- Using "tú" with elders or strangers → Use "usted" until invited to use tú (shows respect)
- Saying "estoy embarazado" (male saying "I'm pregnant") → "Estoy avergonzado" (I'm embarrassed) - false cognate!
- Eating dinner at 6pm in Spain → Most restaurants open 8-9pm, dinner eaten 9-11pm (major timing difference)
- Forgetting "por favor" and "gracias" → Use these constantly (considered basic politeness)
- Standing too far away during conversation → Spanish speakers use closer personal space than some cultures (cultural adjustment needed)
- "Ahorita" meaning "right now" → In Mexico, "ahorita" can mean "in a bit" or "eventually" (context-dependent!)
- Refusing food/drink repeatedly → Accept on second offer to show politeness (first refusal is often polite modesty)
- "Estoy caliente" for "I'm hot (temperature)" → "Tengo calor" (correct) - "Estoy caliente" means "I'm horny" (embarrassing mistake!)

## Cultural Notes

- **Meal times**: In Spain and many parts of Latin America, lunch (2-4pm) is the main meal. Dinner is eaten late (9-11pm in Spain). Restaurants may be closed or empty at 6pm.
- **Siesta tradition**: In Spain and some Latin American countries, businesses close 2-5pm for siesta. Banks and shops reopen in evening. Plan accordingly.
- **Greeting customs**: Cheek kissing is common (one kiss in Latin America, two in Spain). Between men, handshakes are standard. Wait for locals to initiate physical greeting.
- **Personal space**: Spanish speakers typically stand closer during conversation than in Northern European or North American cultures. Don't back away - it can seem cold.
- **Tipping culture**: In Spain, tipping is optional (5-10% for good service). In Latin America, 10% is more standard. Service charge ("servicio") may be included - check the bill.
- **Punctuality**: "Latin time" is real. Social events often start 30-60 minutes late. Business meetings are more punctual. When invited for 8pm dinner, arriving 8:15-8:30 is normal.
- **Directness vs. politeness**: Spanish speakers can be more direct than in some cultures, but politeness phrases ("por favor", "gracias") are essential. Criticism may be more blunt but isn't meant offensively.
- **Personal questions**: Asking about marital status, children, age, or salary is more acceptable than in some cultures. Don't be offended - it shows interest.
- **Loud conversation**: Speaking volume is generally higher. What sounds like arguing may just be animated conversation. Conversely, speaking too quietly may seem unfriendly.
- **Dress code**: Spanish-speaking countries tend toward dressier casual wear. Shorts and flip-flops outside beach areas may look too casual. Europeans especially dress up more for dining out.
- **Using "no" repeatedly**: In some Latin American cultures, repeated "no" can seem rude. Soften refusals: "Tal vez más tarde" (maybe later), "Qué amable, pero..." (how kind, but...).
- **Hand gestures**: Hand gestures are common and expressive. Some gestures have different meanings - observe locals. The "OK" sign (thumb and finger) is offensive in some countries.
- **Sobremesa**: The tradition of lingering at the table after a meal for conversation. This can last 1-2 hours. Rushing off immediately after eating is considered rude.
- **Public displays of affection**: Generally more accepted than in some cultures. Couples commonly hold hands, kiss in public.
- **Formality in business**: Even in casual cultures, initial business meetings are formal. Use titles (Señor, Señora, Doctor) and usted until relationship develops.
- **Religion and tradition**: Many Spanish-speaking countries are predominantly Catholic. Religious holidays affect business hours and closures. Respect religious customs and sites.

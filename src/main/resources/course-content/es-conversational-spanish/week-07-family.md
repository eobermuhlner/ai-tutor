## This Week's Goals

- Talk about family members and relationships
- Master possessive adjectives (mi, tu, su, nuestro)
- Describe physical appearance and personality traits
- Ask and answer questions about family

## Grammar Focus

### Possessive Adjectives

**Rule:** Possessive adjectives in Spanish agree with the thing possessed, not the possessor

Examples:
- Mi hermano (My brother - singular)
- Mis hermanos (My brothers - plural)
- Tu casa (Your house - informal)
- Su familia (His/Her/Your formal family)
- Nuestro padre (Our father - masculine)
- Nuestra madre (Our mother - feminine)

Patterns to Practice:
- Mi/mis (my) - always same form
- Tu/tus (your informal) - always same form
- Su/sus (his/her/your formal/their) - always same form
- Nuestro/nuestra/nuestros/nuestras (our) - agrees in gender AND number

### Adjective Agreement

**Rule:** Adjectives must agree in gender and number with the noun they describe

Examples:
- Mi hermano es alto (My brother is tall - masculine singular)
- Mi hermana es alta (My sister is tall - feminine singular)
- Mis hermanos son altos (My brothers are tall - masculine plural)
- Mis hermanas son altas (My sisters are tall - feminine plural)

Patterns to Practice:
- -o endings become -a for feminine (guapo → guapa)
- -e endings stay the same (inteligente for both genders)
- Add -s for plural (alto → altos, inteligente → inteligentes)

### The Verb "Tener" (to have)

**Rule:** Use "tener" to talk about family members you have

Conjugation:
- (Yo) tengo - I have
- (Tú) tienes - You have (informal)
- (Él/Ella/Usted) tiene - He/She has / You have (formal)
- (Nosotros) tenemos - We have
- (Ellos/Ellas/Ustedes) tienen - They/You all have

Examples:
- Tengo dos hermanos (I have two brothers)
- ¿Tienes hermanas? (Do you have sisters?)
- Ella tiene tres hijos (She has three children)

## Conversation Scenarios

The AI tutor will guide you through conversations about:

### Describing Your Family

Practice talking about how many family members you have, their names, ages, and what they're like. Use possessive adjectives and physical/personality descriptions.

Topics to cover:
- "Tengo ___ hermanos" (I have ___ siblings)
- "Mi padre se llama..." (My father's name is...)
- "Mi hermana es alta y simpática" (My sister is tall and nice)
- "¿Cuántos hermanos tienes?" (How many siblings do you have?)

### Asking About Someone's Family

Practice asking polite questions about family and responding with details about relationships and characteristics.

Topics to cover:
- "¿Tienes hermanos?" (Do you have siblings?)
- "¿Cómo es tu familia?" (What is your family like?)
- "¿Cuántos años tiene tu hermano?" (How old is your brother?)
- "¿Dónde viven tus padres?" (Where do your parents live?)

## Practice Patterns

- Describe each member of your family using 2-3 adjectives
- Practice both singular and plural possessive forms
- Use "tener" to talk about how many family members you have
- Ask your tutor about their family (remember: the AI will role-play)
- Practice distinguishing between masculine and feminine adjectives
- Describe someone without naming them and have the tutor guess who

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- Forgetting adjective agreement: "Mi hermana es alto" → "Mi hermana es alta"
- Using wrong possessive for plural: "Mi hermanos" → "Mis hermanos"
- Confusing "su" meanings (his/her/your/their - context dependent)
- Forgetting gender with "nuestro": "Nuestra padre" → "Nuestro padre"
- Using "tener" incorrectly: "Yo tiene" → "Yo tengo"
- Mixing up "padres" (parents) with "padre" (father)
- Saying "hermana mayor" when you mean "hermano mayor" (older brother - check gender!)

## Cultural Notes

- In Spanish-speaking cultures, extended family is very important
- It's common to live with parents until marriage (or longer)
- Family gatherings are frequent and include many relatives
- Godparents (padrinos/madrinas) are considered part of the family
- The term "tío/tía" is sometimes used affectionately for family friends

## This Week's Goals

- Master common Spanish greetings for different times of day
- Learn how to ask "How are you?" and respond appropriately
- Practice formal vs. informal address
- Build confidence with basic courtesy expressions

## Grammar Focus

### Formal vs. Informal "You"

**Rule:** Spanish has two forms of "you" - tú (informal) and usted (formal)

Examples:
- ¿Cómo estás? (informal - How are you?)
- ¿Cómo está usted? (formal - How are you?)
- Tú eres mi amigo (You are my friend - informal)
- Usted es el profesor (You are the teacher - formal)

Patterns to Practice:
- Use tú with friends, family, children
- Use usted with strangers, elders, professional settings
- When in doubt, start with usted

### Subject Pronouns

**Rule:** Subject pronouns are often omitted in Spanish because verb endings indicate the subject

Examples:
- (Yo) estoy bien (I am fine)
- (Tú) hablas español (You speak Spanish)
- (Él) es de España (He is from Spain)

Patterns to Practice:
- Include pronouns only for emphasis or clarity
- Learn to recognize subjects from verb endings

## Conversation Scenarios

The AI tutor will guide you through conversations about:

### Meeting Someone for the First Time

Practice formal greetings and polite introductions in Spanish.

Topics to cover:
- "¡Hola! Buenos días" (Hello! Good morning)
- "¿Cómo está usted?" (How are you? formal)
- "Mucho gusto" / "Encantado/a" (Nice to meet you)
- "Me llamo..." (My name is...)

### Greeting a Friend

Practice casual greetings with informal register.

Topics to cover:
- "¡Hola! ¿Cómo estás?" (Hi! How are you?)
- "Bien, ¿y tú?" (Fine, and you?)
- "¿Qué tal?" (What's up?)
- "Hasta luego" / "¡Adiós!" (See you later / Goodbye)

## Practice Patterns

- Greet your tutor at different times of day (morning, afternoon, evening)
- Practice introducing yourself using "Me llamo..." (My name is...)
- Ask "¿Cómo estás?" and respond with different states (bien, mal, así así)
- Practice both formal and informal registers in appropriate contexts
- End conversations with different farewell expressions

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- Forgetting to match gender in "encantado/a" (use -o for masculine, -a for feminine)
- Using "buenos días" at night (use "buenas noches" instead)
- Confusing "mucho gusto" (nice to meet you) with "muchas gracias" (thank you very much)
- Pronouncing "h" in "hola" (Spanish "h" is always silent)
- Using "adiós" for temporary goodbyes (use "hasta luego" for "see you later")

## Cultural Notes

- In Spain and many Latin American countries, greetings are more physical (handshakes, cheek kisses)
- "Buenos días" is used until around noon, "buenas tardes" from noon to evening, "buenas noches" in the evening/night
- When meeting someone, it's polite to make eye contact while greeting
- "Mucho gusto" is reserved for first meetings, while "hasta luego" is for temporary partings
- In business settings, use formal titles: "Señor" (Mr.), "Señora" (Mrs.), "Señorita" (Miss)

## Pronunciation Focus

- The Spanish "r" has two sounds: a light tap (carro) and a strong roll (perro)
- The "ll" sound varies by region: some pronounce it like "y" (yo), others like "j" (yo)
- Stress patterns: most words ending in vowel, n, or s stress the second-to-last syllable
- In questions, "¿" and "¡" are placed at the beginning of the sentence
- Silent "h" in Spanish - never pronounce "h" unless it's part of "ch"

## Practice Patterns

- Greet your tutor using appropriate time-of-day greetings
- Practice formal vs informal address based on context
- Use gender agreement with "encantado/a" correctly
- Pronounce greetings with proper Spanish accent patterns
- Match formality level to the situation (use Usted when uncertain)

## Additional Vocabulary

### Time-Specific Greetings
- **Buenos días** - Good morning (until noon)
- **Buenas tardes** - Good afternoon (noon to evening)
- **Buenas noches** - Good evening/night (evening on)

### Politeness Markers
- **Por supuesto** - Of course
- **Con mucho gusto** - With much pleasure (when helping)
- **Disculpe** - Excuse me (formal)
- **Perdóneme** - Forgive me (more formal apology)

### Responses to Greetings
- **Todo bien** - All good
- **Más o menos** - So-so
- **Como siempre** - As always
- **Gracias a Dios** - Thank God (in response to "How are you?")

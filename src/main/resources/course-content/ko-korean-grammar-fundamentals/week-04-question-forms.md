- Master interrogative words (무엇, 누가, 어디, etc.)
- Understand question sentence structure in Korean
- Form both yes/no questions and information questions

## Grammar Focus

### Question Endings

**Rule:** Korean uses specific sentence endings to form questions, different from statements.

** casual polite (해요체):** -어요? / -아요? for verbs, -이에요? / -예요? for nouns/copulas
- **가요?** (gayo?) - "Are you going?"
- **학생이에요?** (haksaeng-ieyo?) - "Are you a student?"

** formal polite (합쇼체):** -ㅂ니까? / -습니까? for verbs, -입니까? for nouns/copulas
- **갑니까?** (gamnikka?) - "Are you going?"
- **학생입니까?** (haksaeng-imnikka?) - "Are you a student?"

### Interrogative Words (의문사 - uimunsa)

**Rule:** Use specific words to ask for specific information.

**Who:** 누구 (nugu) - Who?
- **누가 왔습니까?** (nugu-ga wasseumnikka?) - "Who came?"

**What:** 무엇 (mueot) / 뭐 (mwo) - What?
- **무엇을 먹습니까?** (mueoseul meongseumnikka?) - "What are you eating?"
- **뭐예요?** (mwo-ye-yo?) - "What is it?" (casual)

**Where:** 어디 (eodi) - Where?
- **어디에 갑니까?** (eodi-e gamnikka?) - "Where are you going?"

**When:** 언제 (eonje) - When?
- **언제 옵니까?** (eonje omnikka?) - "When are you coming?"

**Why:** 왜 (wae) - Why?
- **왜 안 왔습니까?** (wae an wasseumnikka?) - "Why didn't you come?"

**How:** 어떻게 (eotteoke) - How?
- **어떻게 했습니까?** (eotteoke haesseumnikka?) - "How did you do it?"

**Which:** 어느 (eoneu) - Which?
- **어느 것이 맞습니까?** (eoneu geosi manhamnikka?) - "Which one is correct?"

### Yes/No Questions

**Rule:** In Korean, yes/no questions often use the same form as statements with rising intonation or question particles.

- **가요?** (gayo?) - "Are you going?" (expecting yes or no)
- **학생이에요?** (haksaeng-ieyo?) - "Are you a student?" (expecting yes or no)

**Special Question Words for Yes/No:**
- **-습니까/습니까?** (seumnikka?) - formal yes/no question ending
- **-어요/아요?** (eoyo/ayo?) - polite yes/no question ending
- **-지** (ji) - tag question ending (equivalent to English "right?")
  - **가요?** (gayo?) - "Are you going?"
  - **가지요?** (gajiyo?) - "You're going, right?" (polite)

### Question Particles

**Rule:** Korean uses specific particles for questions, though they're often omitted in casual speech.

**-가/-이:** Subject question marker
- **누가 왔습니까?** (nugu-ga wasseumnikka?) - "Who came?"

**-를/-을:** Object question marker
- **무엇을 했습니까?** (mueoseul haesseumnikka?) - "What did you do?"

**-에/-에서/-으로:** Location/destination question markers
- **어디에 갔습니까?** (eodi-e gasseumnikka?) - "Where did you go?"

**Negative form:** 가지 않습니다 (gaji anseumnida) / 안 가요 (an gayo)
**Question form:** 갑니까? (gamnikka?) / 가요? (gayo?) / 가? (ga?)

## Conversation Scenarios

### Forming Questions in Daily Life

Practice forming appropriate questions when meeting new people, asking for directions, or making plans.

Key grammar to practice:
- "무엇을 하고 계십니까?" (mueoseul hago gyesimnikka?) - "What are you doing?" (very polite)
- "어디에서 왔습니까?" (eodi-eseo wasseumnikka?) - "Where did you come from?" (formal)
- "왜 그렇게 생각해요?" (wae geureohge saenggak-hae-yo?) - "Why do you think that way?" (polite)
- "언제 한국에 오셨어요?" (eonje hanguge osseo-yo?) - "When did you come to Korea?" (polite)

## Practice Patterns

- Form questions from statements using appropriate endings
- Use appropriate interrogative words for different information
- Convert yes/no questions to information questions
- Practice using question particles in different sentence positions
- Distinguish between formal and polite question forms

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- "무엇 해요?" → "무엇을 해요?" (missing object particle)
- "가요?" → "가십니까?" (inappropriate formality level)
- "왜요?" → "왜입니까?" (inappropriate formality in formal context)
- "누가 왔어?" → "누가 왔습니까?" (inappropriate formality in formal context)
- "뭐 하세요?" → "뭐 하십니까?" (more formal honorific form)

## Cultural Notes

In Korean, asking questions requires careful attention to politeness levels, which can be more complex than in many other languages. The formality level should match the social relationship between speaker and listener. Using formal language (합쇼체) with close friends might create distance, while using casual language with superiors or strangers can be seen as extremely rude. Additionally, Korean has a system of honorifics that often combines with question forms when speaking to or about people of higher status.

## Grammar Focus

### Hangul Syllabary Structure
**Rule:** Hangul consists of 14 basic consonants and 10 basic vowels that combine to form syllable blocks

**Basic Consonants (자음 - Jaeum):**
- **ㄱ (g/k)** - g as in "go" or k as in "ski" (context-dependent)
- **ㄴ (n)** - n as in "no"
- **ㄷ (d/t)** - d as in "do" or t as in "stop" (context-dependent)
- **ㄹ (r/l)** - r between vowels, l at beginning/end
- **ㅁ (m)** - m as in "mom"
- **ㅂ (b/p)** - b as in "boy" or p as in "spin" (context-dependent)
- **ㅅ (s)** - s as in "see"
- **ㅇ (∅/ng)** - silent at beginning, ng as in "sing" at end
- **ㅈ (j/ch)** - j as in "jump" or ch as in "church" (context-dependent)
- **ㅊ (ch)** - ch as in "church" (aspirated)
- **ㅋ (k)** - k as in "ski" (aspirated)
- **ㅌ (t)** - t as in "stop" (aspirated)
- **ㅍ (p)** - p as in "spin" (aspirated)
- **ㅎ (h)** - h as in "hat"

**Basic Vowels (모음 - Moeum):**
- **ㅏ (a)** - a as in "father"
- **ㅑ (ya)** - ya as in "yard"
- **ㅓ (eo)** - eo sound (similar to "uh" but more open)
- **ㅕ (yeo)** - yeo sound (similar to "yeah" but more open)
- **ㅗ (o)** - o as in "go" (rounded)
- **ㅛ (yo)** - yo as in "yonder"
- **ㅜ (u)** - u as in "pool" (rounded)
- **ㅠ (yu)** - yu as in "you"
- **ㅡ (eu)** - eu sound (neutral vowel, similar to French "eux")
- **ㅣ (i)** - i as in "machine"

### Syllable Block Formation
**Rule:** Korean syllables are formed by combining consonants and vowels in blocks

**Structure Patterns:**
1. **CV (Consonant-Vowel):** 가 (ga), 도 (do), 수 (su)
2. **CVC (Consonant-Vowel-Consonant):** 간 (gan), 돈 (don), 산 (san)
3. **CCVC (Consonant-Consonant-Vowel-Consonant):** 강 (gang), 등 (deung), 학 (hak)

**Block Construction Rules:**
- Consonant + Vowel = vertical or horizontal arrangement
- Vertical vowels (ㅏ, ㅑ, ㅓ, ㅕ, ㅣ) = consonant to left of vowel
- Horizontal vowels (ㅗ, ㅛ, ㅜ, ㅠ, ㅡ) = consonant above vowel
- Final consonant = placed below the block

**Examples:**
- **가** = ㄱ + ㅏ (vertical arrangement)
- **고** = ㄱ + ㅗ (horizontal arrangement)
- **간** = ㄱ + ㅏ + ㄴ (final consonant below)
- **강** = ㄱ + ㅏ + ㅇ (final consonant below)

### Pronunciation Guide
**Key Points:**
1. Tense consonants (ㄲ, ㄸ, ㅃ, ㅆ, ㅉ) are pronounced with more tension
2. Aspirated consonants (ㅊ, ㅋ, ㅌ, ㅍ) have a puff of air
3. ㄹ pronunciation varies based on position and surrounding sounds
4. Double consonants at the end of syllables are pronounced as their single counterparts
5. Vowels ㅓ and ㅡ are distinctive sounds not found in English

## Practice Patterns

- Write Hangul characters from romanization
- Practice syllable block construction
- Focus on correct stroke order
- Drill pronunciation with audio examples

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- Wrong form → Correct form (explanation)
- **가 (ga)** ✓ (correct block construction)
- **고 (go)** ✓ (correct horizontal arrangement)
- **간 (gan)** ✓ (correct final consonant placement)
- **강 (gang)** ✓ (correct double consonant)
- **안녕하세요** ✓ (correct polite greeting)
- **감사합니다** ✓ (correct polite thanks)
- **하나, 둘, 셋** ✓ (correct number pronunciation)
- "가" ✓ (correct vertical vowel arrangement)
- "고" ✓ (correct horizontal vowel arrangement)
- "안녕 하세요" → "안녕하세요" (incorrect spacing in one word)
- "감사 해요" → "감사해요" (incorrect spacing in contracted form)
- "han-gul" → "hang-geul" (incorrect pronunciation of double consonant ㅇ)
- "ㅏ" sound should be pure "a" as in "father" ✓
- "ㅓ" sound is unique to Korean, similar to relaxed "uh" ✓
- "ㅡ" sound is neutral, similar to French "eux" ✓

- Proper spacing between words is crucial in Korean (no spaces within syllable blocks)
- Handwriting quality matters in Korean culture, especially for formal documents
- Learning Hangul shows respect for Korean culture and language

- Hangul was created in the 15th century by King Sejong and is celebrated as a cultural treasure
- The scientific design of Hangul makes it possible to learn the basics relatively quickly
- Korean speakers often compliment foreigners on their Hangul skills, even with basic knowledge
- Mobile keyboards make typing Korean easier once the syllable structure is understood
- Understanding Hangul is essential before attempting to learn Korean grammar and vocabulary

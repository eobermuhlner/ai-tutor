## Grammar Focus

### Conditional Forms Overview

**Rule:** Korean has several conditional patterns for expressing "if/when" clauses with different nuances and uses.

**Most Common Conditional: -면 (-myeon)**
- Used for both real and hypothetical conditions
- 가다 → 가면 (gamyeon) - "if/when I go"
- 먹다 → 먹으면 (meogeumyeon) - "if/when I eat"
- 좋다 → 좋으면 (jomyeon) - "if it is good"

**Past-based Conditional: -(으)면 (-eumyeon)**
- Used when the condition is already known or assumed
- 갔다 → 갔으면 (gasseumyeon) - "if I went/had gone"
- 먹었다 → 먹었으면 (meogeosseumyeon) - "if I ate/had eaten"

**Formal Conditional: -(으)므로 (-(eu)nomang)**
- Formal, written Korean
- 가면 → 가지므로 (gajinomang) - "because I go" / "if I go"

| adjectives | 크다 (keuda) | 크면 (keumyeon) | 컸으면 (keusseumyeon) | if it is big |

### Hypothetical and Contrary-to-Fact Conditions

**Rule:** Use specific patterns to express hypothetical or impossible conditions.

**Contrary-to-fact Present:** -(으)면 (-eumyeon) + 지
- **시간이 많으면 좋지** (sigan-i manheumyeon joji) - "If I had more time (but I don't), that would be good"
- **한국어를 할 수 있으면 좋지** (hangugeo-reul hal su isseumyeon joji) - "If I could speak Korean (but I can't), that would be good"

**Contrary-to-fact Past:** -(았/었/였)으면 (-as/ess/yeosseumyeon)
- **공부를 더 열심히 했으면 좋았을 텐데** (gongbu-reul deo yeolsimhi haesseumyeon joasseul tende) - "If I had studied harder (but I didn't), it would have been good"

**Unrealizable Condition:** -(으)ㄹ 텐데 (-eul tende)
- **가고 싶은데 가지 못할 텐데** (gago sipeunde gaji motgal tende) - "I want to go but probably can't go"

### Special Conditional Patterns

**Rule:** Korean has unique conditional expressions for specific contexts.

**-(으)ㄹ 경우 (-eul gyeong-u)** - formal condition (in the case of)
- **불의의 경우** (burui-eui gyeong-u) - "in case of emergency"

**-(으)ㄹ 땐 (-eul ttaen)** - "when" (in informal contexts)
- **졸릴 땐 커피를 마셔** (jollil ttaen keopireul masyeo) - "When you're sleepy, drink coffee"

**-(이)나 (-ina)** - "if or"
- **비가 오거나 눈이 오면** (biga ogeona nun-i omyeon) - "If it rains or snows"

**-(으)ㄹ지 (-eulji) or -(는)지 (-neunji)** - "whether" or "if"
- **올지 안 올지 몰라요** (olji an olji mollayo) - "I don't know whether he'll come or not"

### Conditional with Intentions

**Rule:** Combine conditionals with intention expressions.

- **가면 갈 거예요** (gamyeon gal geo-yo) - "If I go, I will go" (emphatic)
- **가면 가야 해요** (gamyeon gaya haeyo) - "I have to go if I go" (obligation)
- **가면 좋을 텐데** (gamyeon jo-eul tende) - "It would be good if I go"

### Politeness in Conditionals

**Rule:** Maintain appropriate politeness level throughout the conditional sentence.

- **가면 (gamyeon)** - casual conditional
- **가요?** (gayo?) - polite question
- **가면 좋겠습니다** (gamyeon johgetseumnida) - polite conditional result

### Negative Conditionals

**Rule:** Form negative conditionals with different patterns.

**Basic Negative Conditional:**
- **안 가면 (an gamyeon)** - "if not go"
- **가지 않으면 (gaji anheumyeon)** - "if not go" (formal)

**Past Negative Conditional:**
- **가지 않았으면 (gaji anhasseumyeon)** - "if had not gone"
- **안 갔으면 (an gasseumyeon)** - "if hadn't gone" (casual)

### Complex Conditional Patterns

**Rule:** Combine conditionals with other grammatical elements.

**Conditional + Passive:**
- **만들어지면 알려주세요** (mandeul-eojimyeon allyeojuseyo) - "Please let me know when it's made"

**Conditional + Potential:**
- **할 수 있으면 도와줄게** (hal su isseumyeon dowajulge) - "If I can, I'll help"

**Conditional + Causative:**
- **하고 싶으면 해도 돼요** (hago sipeumyeon haedo dwae-yo) - "If you want to do it, you can do it"

**Conditional + Honorific:**
- **오시면 기쁩니다** (osimyeon gippeumnida) - "If you come, I'll be happy" (honorific)

**Negative form:** 가지 않겠습니다 (gaji angetseumnida) / 안 가면 (an gamyeon)
**Question form:** 가면 될까요? (gamyeon doelkkayo?) / 먹어도 될까요? (meogeodo doelkkayo?)

## Conversation Scenarios

### Using Conditionals in Daily Context

Practice forming conditional sentences to discuss possibilities, make suggestions, and express hypothetical situations in appropriate contexts.

Key grammar to practice:
- "시간이 많으면 여행을 가고 싶어요" (sigan-i manheumyeon yeohaeng-eul gago sipeoyo) - "If I have time, I want to travel"
- "비가 오면 우산을 챙기세요" (biga omyeon usan-eul chaenggiseyo) - "If it rains, take an umbrella"
- "더 공부했으면 시험에 합격했을 거예요" (deo gongbuhaesseumyeon sigeome hapgyeokhaesseul geo-yo) - "If I had studied more, I would have passed the exam"
- "하고 싶은 일이 있으면 말씀해 주세요" (hago sipeun ir-i isseumyeon malsseumhae juseyo) - "If there's anything you want to do, please let me know"

## Practice Patterns

- Convert statements to different conditional forms
- Distinguish between real and hypothetical conditionals
- Form contrary-to-fact sentences about present and past situations
- Practice negative conditionals
- Use appropriate politeness in conditional sentences

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- "가면 가요?" → "가면 가요?" (questioning the conditional, not usually done that way)
- "가면 가겠어요" → "가면 가겠어요" (can be correct if emphasizing the future aspect)
- "가요면" → "가면" (wrong conjugation)
- "갔으면 좋았을텐데요" → "갔으면 좋았을 텐데요" (missing space)
- "하고 싶으면 해도 돼요요" → "하고 싶으면 해도 돼요" (double ending)

## Cultural Notes

In Korean, conditional forms are used carefully to express politeness and avoid being too direct. The conditional "면" (myeon) is often softened with additional polite expressions. Korean speakers also frequently use conditional forms to make suggestions less direct: "가면 어떨까요?" (gamyeon eotteolkkayo?) "How about going?" instead of a direct suggestion. When making hypothetical statements, Koreans often add softening expressions like "아마" (ama - probably) or "혹시나" (hoksinana - just in case) to avoid appearing too certain.

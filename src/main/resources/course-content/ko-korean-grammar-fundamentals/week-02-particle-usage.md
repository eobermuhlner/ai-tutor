## Grammar Focus

### Korean Sentence Structure
**Rule:** Korean follows Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order, unlike English's Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)

**Basic Structure:** [Subject] + [Object] + [Verb]
**Example:** 나는 책을 읽는다
**Translation:** I book-ACC read (I read books)

**Polite Structure:** [Subject] + [Object] + [Verb]-습니다/ㅂ니다
**Example:** 저는 책을 읽습니다
**Translation:** I book-ACC read-POLITE (I read books - polite form)

### Essential Particles

#### 이/가 (i/ga) - Subject Marker
**Function:** Marks the grammatical subject of a sentence

**Rules:**
- **이** attaches to nouns ending in a consonant
- **가** attaches to nouns ending in a vowel

**Examples:**
- 고양이**가** 앉아 있다 (A cat is sitting - "cat" is the subject)
- 나는 고양이**가** 좋다 (I like cats - "cats" is the subject)
- 누구**가** 왔습니까? (Who came? - "who" is the subject)

#### 은/는 (eun/neun) - Topic Marker

#### 을/를 (eul/reul) - Object Marker
**Function:** Marks the direct object of a verb - what is being acted upon

- Topic-comment structure (은/는 particle) reflects Korean preference for contextual communication
- Omitting particles sounds very unnatural and can make sentences incomprehensible
- The distinction between 은/는 and 이/가 is challenging even for native speakers in some contexts
- Particles create the rhythm and flow of Korean speech
- Understanding particles helps with comprehension of longer, more complex sentences
- Many Korean learners spend significant time mastering particle usage
- Regional dialects may use particles differently, but standard usage is widely understood
- Korean has a complex system of speech levels that affect politeness markers
- The SOV word order allows for flexible emphasis through particle placement

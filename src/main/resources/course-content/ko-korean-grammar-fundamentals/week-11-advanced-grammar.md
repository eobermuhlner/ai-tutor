## This Week's Goals

- Master subjunctive past tenses (imperfect and perfect subjunctive)
- Learn conditional perfect for complex hypothetical situations
- Understand passive voice constructions in Korean
- Form and use relative clauses correctly
- Apply gerund and participle forms appropriately

## Grammar Focus

### Subjunctive Past Tenses (접속법 과거시제 - Jeopsokbeop gwaseo-sije)

**Rule:** Korean subjunctive past tenses are used in subordinate clauses expressing doubt, wishes, or hypotheticals about past events.

**Uses of Subjunctive Past Tenses:**
1. Doubt or uncertainty about past events
2. Wishes about past situations
3. Hypothetical past conditions
4. Reported speech about past events

### Imperfect Subjunctive (불완료 접속법 - Bulwanryo jeopsokbeop)

**Rule:** Imperfect subjunctive expresses ongoing or habitual past actions in subordinate clauses.

**Formation:** Take the third person plural past tense form, remove -다, add subjunctive endings.

**For regular verbs:**
- **하다 (hada)** → **했** (haet) + **다면** (damyeon) = **한다면** (handamyeon)
- **가다 (gada)** → **갔** (gat) + **다면** (damyeon) = **간다면** (gandamyeon)
- **먹다 (meokda)** → **먹었** (meogeot) + **다면** (damyeon) = **먹었다면** (meogeotdamyeon)

### Complete Imperfect Subjunctive Table

| Verb Type | Dictionary | Imperfect Subjunctive | Translation |
|-----------|------------|----------------------|-------------|
| 하다 verbs | 하다 (hada) | 한다면 (handamyeon) | if do |
| 가다 verbs | 가다 (gada) | 간다면 (gandamyeon) | if go |
| 먹다 verbs | 먹다 (meokda) | 먹는다면 (meokneundamyeon) | if eat |
| 오다 verbs | 오다 (oda) | 오는다면 (oneundamyeon) | if come |
| 보다 verbs | 보다 (boda) | 보는다면 (boneundamyeon) | if see |
| 듣다 verbs | 듣다 (deutda) | 듣는다면 (deutneundamyeon) | if hear |

### Perfect Subjunctive (완료 접속법 - Wanryo jeopsokbeop)

**Rule:** Perfect subjunctive expresses completed past actions in subordinate clauses.

**Formation:** Use past perfect + 이라면/이라면 (iromyeon) or 었/았다면 (eot/ssotdamyeon)

**For regular verbs:**
- **하다 (hada)** → **했** (haet) + **다면** (damyeon) = **했다면** (haetdamyeon)
- **가다 (gada)** → **갔** (gat) + **다면** (damyeon) = **갔다면** (gatdamyeon)
- **먹다 (meokda)** → **먹었** (meogeot) + **다면** (damyeon) = **먹었다면** (meogeotdamyeon)

### Complete Perfect Subjunctive Table

| Verb Type | Dictionary | Perfect Subjunctive | Translation |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 하다 verbs | 하다 (hada) | 했다면 (haetdamyeon) | if had done |
| 가다 verbs | 가다 (gada) | 갔다면 (gatdamyeon) | if had gone |
| 먹다 verbs | 먹다 (meokda) | 먹었다면 (meogeotdamyeon) | if had eaten |
| 오다 verbs | 오다 (oda) | 왔다면 (watdamyeon) | if had come |
| 보다 verbs | 보다 (boda) | 봤다면 (bwatdamyeon) | if had seen |
| 듣다 verbs | 듣다 (deutda) | 들었다면 (deureotdamyeon) | if had heard |

### When to Use Subjunctive Past Tenses

**Rule:** Korean uses subjunctive past tenses in specific contexts requiring doubt, wishes, or hypotheticals.

**With Expressions of Doubt/Wish:**
- **모를 수도 있다** (moreul sudo itda) - might not know
- **바랬다면** (baraetdamyeon) - if I had wished
- **꼈다면** (kkeujyeotdamyeon) - if I had thought

**With Hypothetical Past Conditions:**
- **시간이 더 있었다면** (sigan-i deo isseotdamyeon) - if I had had more time
- **돈이 더 있었다면** (don-i deo isseotdamyeon) - if I had had more money
- **공부를 더 열심히 했다면** (gongbu-reul deo yeolsimhi haetdamyeon) - if I had studied harder

**With Reported Speech:**
- **그가 왔다면 좋겠다고 했다** (geuga watdamyeon jogetdago haetda) - He said he hoped he had come
- **선생님께서 시간이 있으시다면 만나뵐 수 있을 것이라고 말씀하셨다** (seonsaengnim-kkeseo sigan-i isseusidamyeon mannabwal su isseul geos-irago mareumhasyeotda) - The teacher said that if he had time, he could meet

### Conditional Perfect (조건완료형 - Jungwonwanryo-hyeong)

**Rule:** Conditional perfect expresses hypothetical past actions (would have done).

**Uses of Conditional Perfect:**
1. Hypothetical past situations: **시간이 더 있었다면 공부했을 텐데** (If I had had more time, I would have studied)
2. Regret about past actions: **더 열심히 했더라면 시험에 합격했을 텐데** (If I had tried harder, I would have passed the exam)
3. Speculation about past: **그가 왔다면 전화를 했을 것이다** (If he had come, he would have called)

### Conditional Perfect Formation

**Rule:** Conditional perfect uses past perfect + past conditional endings.

**Formation:** Past perfect + **았/었/였을 것이다** (at/eot/yeosseul geos-ida)

**Examples:**
- **했을 것이다** (haesseul geos-ida) - would have done
- **갔을 것이다** (gasseul geos-ida) - would have gone
- **먹었을 것이다** (meogeosseul geos-ida) - would have eaten
- **왔을 것이다** (wasseul geos-ida) - would have come
- **봤을 것이다** (bwasseul geos-ida) - would have seen
- **들었을 것이다** (deureosseul geos-ida) - would have heard

### Complete Conditional Perfect Table

| Verb Type | Dictionary | Conditional Perfect | Translation |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 하다 verbs | 하다 (hada) | 했을 것이다 (haesseul geos-ida) | would have done |
| 가다 verbs | 가다 (gada) | 갔을 것이다 (gasseul geos-ida) | would have gone |
| 먹다 verbs | 먹다 (meokda) | 먹었을 것이다 (meogeosseul geos-ida) | would have eaten |
| 오다 verbs | 오다 (oda) | 왔을 것이다 (wasseul geos-ida) | would have come |
| 보다 verbs | 보다 (boda) | 봤을 것이다 (bwasseul geos-ida) | would have seen |
| 듣다 verbs | 듣다 (deutda) | 들었을 것이다 (deureosseul geos-ida) | would have heard |

### Passive Voice Constructions (수동태 - Sudongtae)

**Rule:** Korean passive voice shifts focus from the actor to the receiver of the action.

**Uses of Passive Voice:**
1. Unknown actor: **문이 열렸다** (The door opened)
2. Unimportant actor: **책이 출판되었다** (The book was published)
3. Formal writing: **규칙이 준수되어야 한다** (Rules must be observed)

### Passive Voice Formation

**Rule:** Korean has several ways to form passive voice.

**True Passive with 이다/되다/받다:**
- **이다**: **만들다** (to make) → **만들어지다** (to be made)
- **되다**: **닫다** (to close) → **닫히다** (to be closed)
- **받다**: **읽다** (to read) → **읽히다** (to be read)

**Examples:**
- **문이 열렸다** (muni yeollyeotda) - The door opened (literally: door was opened)
- **책이 출판되었다** (chaeg-i chulpandoeotda) - The book was published
- **편지가 쓰여졌다** (pyeonji-ga sseuyeojetda) - The letter was written

### Complete Passive Voice Table

| Verb Type | Dictionary | Passive Form | Translation |
|-----------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| 만들다 verbs | 만들다 (mandeulda) | 만들어지다 (mandeureojida) | to be made |
| 닫다 verbs | 닫다 (datda) | 닫히다 (dathida) | to be closed |
| 읽다 verbs | 읽다 (ilkda) | 읽히다 (ilkhida) | to be read |
| 쓰다 verbs | 쓰다 (ssuda) | 쓰이다 (sswida) | to be written |
| 주다 verbs | 주다 (juda) | 주어지다 (jueojida) | to be given |
| 받다 verbs | 받다 (batda) | 받아지다 (batajida) | to be received |
| 보다 verbs | 보다 (boda) | 보여지다 (boyoejida) | to be seen |
| 듣다 verbs | 듣다 (deutda) | 들려지다 (deullyeojida) | to be heard |

### Relative Clauses (관계사절 - Gwan-gyesajeol)

**Rule:** Korean relative clauses modify nouns and are introduced by relative pronouns.

**Uses of Relative Clauses:**
1. Noun modification: **읽은 책** (the book that I read)
2. Complex sentence construction: **그녀가 사랑하는 남자** (the man that she loves)
3. Descriptive expressions: **바다를 보러 가는 길** (the road to go see the ocean)

### Relative Clause Formation

**Rule:** Korean relative clauses use the verb stem + relative clause endings.

**Present Tense Relative Clauses:**
- **읽는 책** (ilgneun chaeg) - the book that I'm reading
- **사는 사람** (saneun saram) - the person who lives

**Past Tense Relative Clauses:**
- **읽은 책** (ilgeun chaeg) - the book that I read
- **산 사람** (san saram) - the person who lived

**Future Tense Relative Clauses:**
- **읽을 책** (ilgeul chaeg) - the book that I will read
- **살 사람** (sal saram) - the person who will live

### Complete Relative Clause Table

| Tense | Ending | Example (읽다) | Example (살다) | Translation |
|-------|--------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| Present | -는/-은 | 읽**는** 책 | 사**는** 사람 | reading book / living person |
| Past | -ㄴ/-은 | 읽**은** 책 | 사**ㄴ** 사람 | read book / lived person |
| Future | -ㄹ/-을 | 읽**을** 책 | 살 **을** 사람 | book to read / person to live |
| Ongoing Past | -던 | 읽**던** 책 | 살**던** 집 | book I was reading / house I lived in |

### Gerund and Participle Usage (부사형/분사형 - Busa-hyeong/Bunsa-hyeong)

**Rule:** Korean uses gerund and participle forms to create complex expressions.

**Gerund (-면서/-으면서):**
- **가면서** (gamyenseo) - while going
- **먹으면서** (meogeumyeonseo) - while eating
- **공부하면서** (gongbuhamyeonseo) - while studying

**Participle (-아/어/여서):**
- **가서** (gaseo) - having gone/so that I go
- **먹어서** (meogeoseo) - having eaten/so that I eat
- **공부해서** (gongbuhaeseo) - having studied/so that I study

### Complete Gerund and Participle Table

| Verb Type | Dictionary | Gerund | Participle | Translation |
|-----------|------------|--------|------------|-------------|
| 가다 verbs | 가다 (gada) | 가면서 (gamyenseo) | 가서 (gaseo) | while going / having gone |
| 먹다 verbs | 먹다 (meokda) | 먹으면서 (meogeumyeonseo) | 먹어서 (meogeoseo) | while eating / having eaten |
| 공부하다 verbs | 공부하다 (gongbu-hada) | 공부하면서 (gongbuhamyeonseo) | 공부해서 (gongbuhaeseo) | while studying / having studied |
| 읽다 verbs | 읽다 (ilkda) | 읽으면서 (ilgeumyeonseo) | 읽어서 (ilgeoseo) | while reading / having read |

## Conversation Scenarios

### Using Advanced Grammar Structures in Context

Practice using advanced grammar structures when discussing hypothetical past situations, complex relationships, and formal discourse.

Key grammar to practice:
- **시간이 더 있었다면 더 열심히 공부했을 텐데** (If I had had more time, I would have studied harder)
- **문이 열렸다** (The door opened)
- **읽은 책이 재미있었다** (The book that I read was interesting)
- **가면서 이야기했다** (Talked while going)

## Practice Patterns

- Form imperfect and perfect subjunctive correctly
- Use conditional perfect for complex hypotheticals
- Construct passive voice sentences in various forms
- Create relative clauses with appropriate endings
- Apply gerund and participle forms correctly
- Combine multiple advanced grammar structures
- Distinguish between formal and informal usage contexts

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- **시간이 더 있었다면 공부했을 것이다** → correct, but **시간이 더 있었다면 공부할 것이다** → incorrect tense
- **문이 열다** → **문이 열렸다** (wrong passive form)
- **읽는 책이 재미있었다** → **읽은 책이 재미있었다** (wrong relative clause tense)
- **가서 이야기했다** → correct, but **가면서 이야기했다** → different meaning (sequential vs. simultaneous)
- **공부해서 음악을 들었다** → correct, but **공부하면서 음악을 들었다** → different meaning (cause-effect vs. simultaneous)
- **시간이 더 있었다면** → correct, but **시간이 더 있다면** → incorrect tense (should be past)
- **공부했을 것이다** → correct, but **공부할 것이었다** → incorrect form

## Cultural Notes

In Korean culture, advanced grammar structures are essential for academic writing, formal discourse, and nuanced expression. The subjunctive past tenses are particularly important in literature and formal speech. Korean speakers also use passive voice constructions more frequently than English speakers, especially in formal and academic contexts where formality is valued over directness. Understanding relative clauses helps create more complex and sophisticated sentences. The gerund and participle forms are also crucial for expressing simultaneous actions and cause-effect relationships. Mastery of these advanced structures helps achieve higher levels of fluency and cultural authenticity in Korean communication. Korean speakers appreciate when learners make an effort to use these complex grammatical structures correctly, as it shows respect for the language's sophistication.

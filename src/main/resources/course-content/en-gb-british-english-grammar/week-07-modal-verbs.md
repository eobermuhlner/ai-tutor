## Grammar Focus

### Modal Verb "Can" (British Usage)

**Rule:** Use "can" to express ability, permission, or make requests. British English often uses "can" for present ability.

Uses:
- **Ability:** I **can** swim very well
- **Permission:** **Can** I leave early? (informal) or **May** I leave early? (formal)
- **Request:** **Can** you help me, please?

### Modal Verb "Must" vs. "Have to" (British)

**Rule:** British English often uses "have to" instead of "must" for external obligations.

Examples:
- British: I **have to** finish this by Friday (external requirement)
- British: I **must** study for the exam (internal necessity)

### Modal Verb "Should"

**Rule:** Use "should" to give advice or make recommendations.

Uses:
- **Advice:** You **should** eat more vegetables
- **Recommendation:** We **should** leave now to avoid traffic

### Modal Verb "Will" vs. "Shall" (British)

**Rule:** British English often uses "shall" with first person for offers and questions, unlike American English.

Uses:
- **Questions:** **Shall** I open the window? (British)
- **Offers:** **Shall** we go? (British)
- **Future:** I **will** call you tomorrow (both)

**Rule:** British English uses "may" more frequently than American English for permission.

Uses:
- **Permission:** **May** I use your phone? (formal)
- **Possibility:** It **may** rain tomorrow / It **might** rain (less likely)

### Negative Forms and Questions (British)

**Negative:** Modal + not
- You **cannot/can't** go outside

- British: You **needn't** worry (need as modal)

**Questions:** Modal + subject?

## Conversation Scenarios

### Expressing Ability, Permission, and Obligation in British English

Practice using modal verbs appropriately when discussing ability, making requests, giving advice, and expressing necessity in British contexts, especially noting the use of "shall" and "have to."

Key grammar to practice:
- "I can speak English" (ability)
- "May I borrow your pen?" (formal permission)
- "You should see a doctor" (advice)
- "I have to finish this project by Friday" (external obligation - British)

## Practice Patterns

- Form sentences expressing ability, permission, and obligation in British English
- Create questions and negatives with modal verbs using British preferences
- Identify appropriate modal for different contexts in British English
- Distinguish between similar modals (can vs may for permission)
- Rewrite sentences using different modal verbs appropriate to British usage

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- "I can to swim" → "I can swim" (modal verbs don't use "to")
- "She cans swim" → "She can swim" (modals don't add -s)
- "Can I may use your phone?" → "May I use your phone?" (two modals together)
- "He musts go now" → "He must go now" (modals don't add -s)
- "Shall I?" in American context → Use "Should I?" or "Will I?" in American English

## Cultural Notes

In British English, "may" is more commonly used for permission than in American English ("May I go?" vs. American "Can I go?"). Also, British English often uses "shall" with first person for future questions and offers: "Shall we go?" instead of American preference for "Should we go?" or "Will we go?" Additionally, British English uses "have to" more frequently than "must" for external obligations.

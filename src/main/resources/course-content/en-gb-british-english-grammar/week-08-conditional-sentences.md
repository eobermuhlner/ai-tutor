## This Week's Goals

- Master the structure and use of zero conditional for general truths in British English
- Learn first conditional for real future possibilities with British usage
- Understand second conditional for unreal present situations in British context
- Begin third conditional for unreal past situations in British English

## Grammar Focus

### Zero Conditional (British Usage)

**Rule:** Use present simple in both clauses for scientific facts or general truths.

Structure: If + present simple, present simple

Examples:
- If you heat ice, it melts
- If it rains, the ground gets wet
- When I'm tired, I sleep

### First Conditional (British Usage)

**Rule:** Use present simple in if-clause and will + base verb in main clause for real future possibilities.

Structure: If + present simple, will + base verb

Examples:
- If it rains tomorrow, I will stay home
- I will call you if I have time
- If you study hard, you will pass the exam

### Second Conditional (British Formality)

**Rule:** Use past simple in if-clause and would + base verb in main clause for unreal present situations. British English often uses this more formally than American English.

Structure: If + past simple, would + base verb

Examples:
- If I had more money, I would travel the world
- I would be happy if I won the lottery
- If I were you, I would take that job (British formal use of "were")

Note: British English typically uses "If I were" consistently in second conditional (formal), which is more standard than American English that sometimes accepts "If I was."

### Complete Conditional Reference Table (British Focus)

| Type | If-Clause (Condition) | Main Clause (Result) | British Usage Note | Example |
|------|----------------------|---------------------|------------------|---------|
| Zero | Present Simple | Present Simple | General truth | If you mix oil and water, they separate |
| First | Present Simple | Will + Base Verb | Real future | If I have time, I will help you |
| Second | Past Simple | Would + Base Verb | Unreal present | If I were rich, I would buy a yacht |
| Third | Past Perfect | Would have + Past Participle | Unreal past | If I had studied, I would have passed |

### Third Conditional (British Usage)

**Rule:** Use past perfect in if-clause and would have + past participle in main clause for unreal past situations.

Structure: If + past perfect, would have + past participle

Examples:
- If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam
- I would have called you if I had known your number

### Mixed Conditionals (British Usage)

**Rule:** Combine different conditional structures for complex time situations. British English uses these frequently for nuanced expression.

Examples:
- If I had won the lottery (past), I would be rich now (present)
- If I were rich now (present), I would have bought a car (past ability)

### British vs American Conditional Usage

**Rule:** British English sometimes uses different constructions than American English.

Examples:
- British: I would have liked to have seen it
- American: I would have liked to see it
- British: If I were to win, I would be happy (formal)
- American: More likely "If I won, I would be happy"

**Negative form:** If I didn't work here, I wouldn't know him. / If I had studied, I wouldn't have failed.
**Question form:** What would you do if you won the lottery? / Would you go if you were invited?

## Essential Vocabulary

### Supporting Vocabulary
- **conditional** - expressing a condition or dependency
- **clause** - part of a sentence containing subject and verb
- **subjunctive** - mood expressing what is hypothetical
- **counterfactual** - contrary to fact

### British Conditional Connectors
- **If:** If it rains, we'll stay inside
- **Unless:** Unless you hurry, you'll be late (meaning "if not")
- **As long as:** I'll help as long as you need
- **Provided that:** You can borrow my car provided that you return it
- **In case:** I'll take an umbrella in case it rains (British preference)

## Conversation Scenarios

### Hypothetical Situations and Possibilities in British Context

Practice forming conditional sentences when discussing possibilities, making plans, and talking about unreal situations with British English preferences, especially noting the consistent use of "were" in second conditional.

Key grammar to practice:
- "If I have time, I will visit you" (first conditional)
- "If I were taller, I would play basketball" (second conditional with British "were")
- "If I had known, I would have helped" (third conditional)
- "What would you do if you won a million pounds?" (British currency reference)

## Practice Patterns

- Complete conditional sentences with correct verb forms using British preferences
- Identify which conditional type is being used
- Transform sentences from one conditional type to another
- Create conditional sentences based on given situations
- Distinguish between real and unreal conditional situations in British context

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- "If I will go, I will call you" → "If I go, I will call you" (don't use will in if-clause)
- "If I would study, I would pass" → "If I studied, I would pass" (wrong second conditional)
- "If I was you" → "If I were you" (British formal subjunctive)
- "If I would have known" → "If I had known" (wrong third conditional)
- "If I will have time" → "If I have time" (don't use will in if-clause)

## Cultural Notes

British English often uses "if I were to" for more formal second conditionals: "If I were to win the lottery, I would travel the world." Also, British English uses "in case" more frequently than American English for conditionals: "I'll take an umbrella in case it rains" rather than "just in case."

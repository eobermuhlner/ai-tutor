## This Week's Goals

- Review and consolidate all major grammar points covered in the British English course
- Practice integrating multiple grammar concepts in complex sentences with British preferences
- Identify and correct common grammatical errors specific to British English
- Develop confidence in using grammar structures in British context

## Grammar Focus

### Comprehensive Grammar Integration (British Focus)

**Rule:** Combine multiple grammar concepts learned throughout the course to form complex, nuanced sentences with British English preferences.

Examples integrating multiple concepts:
- **Present Perfect:** I **have been studying** all night (British preference over simple past for recent activity)
- **Conditionals + Passive:** "If I **had been invited**, I **would have attended**" (British formal second conditional with "had been")
- **Collective Nouns:** "The team **are playing** well" (British plural verb agreement)

### Complex Sentence Structures (British Style)

**Rule:** Combine simple clauses using coordinating and subordinating conjunctions to form complex sentences with British preferences.

Examples:
- **Compound:** I studied hard, **and** I passed the exam
- **Complex:** Although I was tired, I continued working
- **British formal:** It is important that he **should** attend the meeting (subjunctive with "should")

### Complete Grammar Review Table (British Focus)

| Grammar Point | British Structure | Example | American Difference |
|---------------|------------------|---------|-------------------|
| Present Tense | Subject + base verb (+s for 3rd person) | She **works** daily | Same |
| Past Tense | Subject + past form | I **visited** yesterday | Same |
| Present Perfect | Has/have + past participle | I **have eaten** | British: more frequent usage |
| Articles | A/An/The + noun | **A book** / **The book** | British: "at university" vs "at the university" |
| Comparatives | More/more + adj. or adj. + -er | More beautiful / Taller | Same |
| Prepositions | Verb + preposition | Go **to** school | British: "at the weekend" |
| Pronouns | Subject/Object forms | **She** knows **me** | British: "team are" vs "team is" |
| Modals | Modal + base verb | I **can** swim | British: "shall" for offers/questions |
| Conditionals | If-clause + main clause | If I study, I will pass | British: "If I were" consistently |
| Passive | Be + past participle | The book **was written** | British: more frequent usage |

### British vs American Grammar Differences

**Rule:** Several grammatical structures differ between British and American English.

Examples:
- **Present Perfect vs Simple Past:** British: "I've just eaten" vs American: "I just ate"
- **Collective Nouns:** British: "The government are" vs American: "The government is"
- **Have/Have Got:** British: "Have you got a pen?" vs American: "Do you have a pen?"
- **Prepositions:** British: "at the weekend" vs American: "on the weekend"

**Negative form:** I have not finished the work yet. / The letter was not sent.
**Question form:** Have you finished the work? / Where was the letter sent?

## Essential Vocabulary

### Supporting Vocabulary
- **syntax** - arrangement of words and phrases
- **morphology** - form and structure of words
- **agreement** - matching between subject and verb, noun and adjective
- **coherence** - logical connection between ideas

### British Grammar Review Terms
- **Simple sentence:** Contains one independent clause
- **Compound sentence:** Contains two or more independent clauses
- **Complex sentence:** Contains one independent and one or more dependent clauses
- **Formal British:** Uses more passive voice, subjunctive, and complex structures

### British Advanced Constructions
- **Subjunctive mood:** If I **were** rich (unreal condition - British consistency)
- **Causative:** I had my car **repaired**
- **Perfect tenses:** Emphasis on completion with connection to present

## Conversation Scenarios

### Integrating All Grammar Concepts in British Context

Practice using a combination of all grammar concepts learned in the course when engaging in more complex conversations using British English preferences.

Key grammar to practice:
- "If I had studied harder, I might have been more successful" (complex conditional with modal)
- "The team are playing well, and they have been doing so consistently" (collective noun with plural verb and present perfect)
- "I've just eaten, so I'm not hungry" (British present perfect usage)
- "Have you got any questions?" (British "have got" construction)

## Practice Patterns

- Create complex sentences combining multiple grammar concepts with British preferences
- Identify British vs American grammar differences in complex sentences
- Correct sentences containing multiple errors in British context
- Transform simple sentences into compound or complex sentences using British structures
- Practice advanced structures like present perfect for recent past activities

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- **Present Perfect:** "I already ate" → "I have already eaten" (British preference)
- **Collective nouns:** "The team is" → "The team are" (British plural agreement)
- **Have/Have got:** "Do you have a pen?" → "Have you got a pen?" (British preference)
- **"If I was" vs "If I were":** "If I were you" (British formal subjunctive)
- **Prepositions:** "on the weekend" → "at the weekend" (British usage)

## Cultural Notes

British English often uses more complex sentence structures and passive voice than American English in formal contexts. In written British English, particularly in academic and formal business writing, you'll find more elaborate subordination with multiple dependent clauses and formal vocabulary. British English also emphasizes the present perfect for recent activities that have current relevance, unlike American English which might use simple past.

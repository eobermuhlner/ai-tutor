## This Week's Goals

- Master the basic forms of present, past, and future tenses in British English
- Understand the difference between regular and irregular verbs
- Learn to form simple sentences using different verb tenses
- Practice using time indicators with each tense, noting British usage

## Grammar Focus

### Present Tense

**Rule:** For regular verbs, the present tense uses the base form of the verb. For third person singular, add -s or -es.

Examples:
- I/You/We/They **work** every day
- He/She/It **works** every day
- He **goes** to school daily

### Past Tense

**Rule:** For regular verbs, add -ed to the base form. Irregular verbs have special forms that must be memorized.

Examples:
- Regular: I **worked**, You **played**, They **visited**
- Irregular: I **went**, You **ate**, He **saw**, She **wrote**

### Future Tense

**Rule:** Form future tense using auxiliary "will" + base form of the verb or "going to" construction.

Examples:
- I **will go** to the park tomorrow
- She **is going to study** for her exam next week
- They **will travel** to Europe next month

### Complete Conjugation Table - Regular Verbs

| Person | Present | Past | Future |
|--------|---------|------|--------|
| I | work | worked | will work |
| You | work | worked | will work |
| He/She/It | works | worked | will work |
| We | work | worked | will work |

### Common Irregular Verbs Table (British Focus)

| Base | Past | Past Participle | British Usage Note |
|------|------|----------------|-------------------|
| go | went | gone | Perfect tenses used more frequently |
| have | had | had | Have got (British) vs. gotten (American) |
| get | got | got/gotten | British often use 'got' for past participle |
| learn | learnt | learnt | British prefer -t endings |
| dream | dreamt | dreamt | British prefer -t endings |

### British Present Perfect Usage

**Rule:** British English uses present perfect more frequently than American English for recent events, even with specific time markers.

Examples:
- British: "I **have** just **eaten**" (recent action)
- British: "Have you **seen** my keys?" (recent past)
- British: "I **have** already **done** that today" (with time indicator)

**Negative form:** I do not work. / I did not work. / I will not work.
**Question form:** Do I work? / Did I work? / Will I work?

## Essential Vocabulary

### Supporting Vocabulary
- **tense** - verb form indicating time
- **regular** - following standard pattern
- **irregular** - not following standard pattern
- **auxiliary** - helping verb
- **perfect tense** - emphasizing completion of action

### British Time Indicators
- **Present:** every day, usually, always, now, today
- **Past:** yesterday, last week/month/year, ago, already, just, yet (in questions/negatives)
- **Future:** tomorrow, next week/month/year, soon, will, going to

## Conversation Scenarios

### Using Verb Tenses in British Context

Practice forming sentences about your daily routine, past experiences, and future plans using appropriate verb tenses with British preferences.

Key grammar to practice:
- "I usually work at the office" (present)
- "I have just watched that programme" (British present perfect)
- "Tomorrow I will go shopping" (future)
- "I am going to call my mother" (future intention)

## Practice Patterns

- Conjugate regular verbs in all three tenses for all pronouns
- Rewrite irregular verb sentences in different tenses
- Transform present tense sentences to past and future
- Complete sentences with the correct verb tense
- Create sentences using time indicators with each tense

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- "I have went" → "I have gone" (wrong past participle with present perfect)
- "He don't work here" → "He doesn't work here" (wrong third person singular negative)
- "She will goes to the store" → "She will go to the store" (future tense doesn't add -s)
- "I was went to the park" → "I went to the park" (mixed past tense forms)
- "I work yesterday" → "I worked yesterday" (wrong tense for time reference)

## Cultural Notes

In British English, the present perfect tense is used more frequently than in American English, especially for actions completed in the present day: "I have already eaten" vs. American "I already ate." Also, British English often uses "Have you got...?" instead of "Do you have...?" for asking about possession.

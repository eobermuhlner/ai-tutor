## Conversation Scenarios

### Discussing Time and Location in British Context

Practice using prepositions correctly when talking about time, location, and direction in British English conversations, especially focusing on differences from American English.

Key grammar to practice:
- "I will meet you at university at 3 PM" (British article usage)
- "The book is on the table next to the computer" (location)
- "She walked from the car into the building" (direction)
- "I'll see you at the weekend" (British time expression)

## Practice Patterns

- Choose the correct preposition for time expressions with British usage
- Identify appropriate prepositions for spatial relationships in British context
- Form sentences using prepositions of direction
- Create sentences with common prepositional phrases
- Complete gaps with the correct preposition in British English

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- "I will meet you in 3 PM" → "I will meet you at 3 PM" (wrong time preposition)
- "I live in New York Street" → "I live on New York Street" (wrong place preposition)
- "I go to hospital" → "I go to the hospital" (American usage)
- "I go to university" → "I go to the university" (American usage)
- "She arrived to the airport" → "She arrived at the airport" (wrong arrival preposition)

## Cultural Notes

In British English, there are specific preposition differences from American English: Britons say "at the weekend" while Americans say "on the weekend." Also, British English often uses "in hospital" while American English requires "in the hospital," and "at university" vs. "at the university" in American English. These article omissions are common with institutions in British English.

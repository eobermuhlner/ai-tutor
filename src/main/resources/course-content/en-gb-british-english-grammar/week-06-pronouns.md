## This Week's Goals

- Master personal pronouns in subject and object forms in British English
- Use possessive pronouns correctly (my/mine, your/yours, etc.) with British preferences
- Understand and use demonstrative pronouns (this/that/these/those) in British context
- Learn reflexive pronouns and their proper usage in British English

## Grammar Focus

### Personal Pronouns

**Rule:** Subject pronouns come before the verb; object pronouns come after verbs or prepositions.

Subject pronouns: I, you, he, she, it, we, they
Object pronouns: me, you, him, her, it, us, them

Examples:
- **Subject:** **I** work here. **She** sings beautifully.
- **Object:** The teacher knows **me**. I like **her** very much.

### British Collective Noun Agreement

**Rule:** In British English, collective nouns (team, family, company) often take plural verbs, unlike American English.

Examples:
- British: The team **are** playing well
- American: The team **is** playing well
- British: The government **are** discussing the matter
- American: The government **is** discussing the matter

### Complete Personal Pronoun Table

| Person | Subject | Object | British Example (Subject) | British Example (Object) |
|--------|---------|--------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1st Sing. | I | me | **I** study | Give it to **me** |
| 2nd Sing. | you | you | **You** work | I know **you** |
| 3rd Sing. M | he | him | **He** runs | I see **him** |
| 3rd Sing. F | she | her | **She** works | I help **her** |
| 3rd Sing. N | it | it | **It** flies | I bought **it** |
| 1st Plural | we | us | **We** play | Call **us** |
| 2nd Plural | you | you | **You** study | We met **you** |
| 3rd Plural | they | them | **They** run | I know **them** |

### Possessive Pronouns

**Rule:** Use "my, your, his, her, its, our, their" before nouns; use "mine, yours, his, hers, ours, theirs" without nouns.

Examples:
- **With noun:** This is **my** car. Those are **their** books.
- **Without noun:** The car is **mine**. The books are **theirs**.

### Demonstrative Pronouns

**Rule:** "This/these" for things near you; "that/those" for things farther away.

Examples:
- **Near:** **This** is my pen. **These** are my books.
- **Far:** **That** is my car. **Those** are my friends.

### Reflexive Pronouns

**Rule:** Use reflexive pronouns when the subject and object are the same person/thing.

Examples:
- I hurt **myself**. She bought **herself** a gift.
- We taught **ourselves**. They enjoy **themselves**.

### British vs American Pronoun Usage

**Rule:** Some subtle differences exist between British and American pronoun usage.

Examples:
- British: "I've got a pen" (with "have got")
- American: "I have a pen"
- British: "I'll give her one myself" (emphatic)
- American: "I'll give her one myself" (same but usage differs)

### Complete Reflexive Pronoun Table

| Personal Pronoun | Reflexive Pronoun | British Example |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| I | myself | I see **myself** |
| you | yourself/yourselves | See **yourself** |
| he | himself | He hurt **himself** |
| she | herself | She dressed **herself** |
| it | itself | The cat cleaned **itself** |
| we | ourselves | We helped **ourselves** |
| they | themselves | They taught **themselves** |

**Negative form:** I don't know him. / Myself, I don't agree (British emphasis).
**Question form:** Do you know him? / Who is that? / What is this?

## Essential Vocabulary

### Supporting Vocabulary
- **pronoun** - word replacing a noun
- **subject** - who performs the action
- **object** - who receives the action
- **reflexive** - referring back to the subject
- **collective noun** - noun referring to a group

### British Possessive Adjectives vs Pronouns
- **Adjectives:** my, your, his, her, its, our, their
- **Pronouns:** mine, yours, his, hers, ours, theirs

### Demonstratives
- **Singular near:** this, that
- **Plural near:** these, those

## Conversation Scenarios

### Using Pronouns in British Daily Communication

Practice replacing nouns with appropriate pronouns in conversations, paying attention to British usage patterns especially with collective nouns and the "have got" construction.

Key grammar to practice:
- "Where is John? I don't see him" (object pronoun)
- "This is my book and that one is yours" (demonstrative and possessive)
- "The team are playing well" (collective noun with plural verb - British)
- "These are our friends and those are theirs" (demonstrative and possessive)

## Practice Patterns

- Replace nouns with appropriate personal pronouns in British context
- Choose between possessive adjectives and pronouns
- Use demonstrative pronouns correctly based on distance
- Form sentences with reflexive pronouns
- Identify correct pronoun case (subject vs object) with British collective nouns

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- "Me and John went" → "John and I went" (wrong subject pronoun)
- "Give it to she" → "Give it to her" (wrong object pronoun)
- "This are my books" → "These are my books" (number agreement)
- "The team is playing" → "The team are playing" (British collective usage)
- "He and myself went" → "He and I went" or "He went with me" (reflexive misused)

## Cultural Notes

In British English, "myself" is sometimes used more frequently than in American English for emphasis or formality: "I myself don't agree" instead of simply "I don't agree." Also, British English frequently uses "have got" instead of "have" for possession: "Have you got a pen?" vs. American "Do you have a pen?"

## This Week's Goals

- Learn proper placement of adjectives in British English sentences
- Master comparative and superlative forms with British preferences
- Understand adverb formation from adjectives in British context
- Use degrees of comparison accurately in British English

## Grammar Focus

### Adjective Position

**Rule:** Adjectives typically come before the noun they modify in English.

Examples:
- **A red car** is parked outside
- I bought **three expensive books**
- She has **a beautiful house**

Exception: Some adjectives come after linking verbs (be, seem, appear)
- The car **is red**
- The books **are expensive**

### British English Comparative and Superlative Forms

**Rule:** Form comparatives with -er/more and superlatives with -est/most. British English sometimes prefers different constructions.

Regular adjectives:
- Short (1-2 syllables): tall → taller → tallest
- Long (3+ syllables): beautiful → more beautiful → most beautiful

Examples:
- Comparative: She is **taller** than her sister
- Superlative: She is **the tallest** in her family
- Long adjectives: He is **more careful** than before / **the most careful** student

### British vs American Preference in Degrees of Comparison

**Rule:** Some preferences differ between British and American English.

Examples:
- British: "more common" or "commoner" (both acceptable)
- American: typically "more common" only
- British: "farther" for distance, "further" for abstract concepts
- American: both often used interchangeably

### Irregular Comparatives and Superlatives

| Adjective | Comparative | Superlative | Note |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|------|
| good/well | better | best | Standard |
| bad | worse | worst | Standard |
| far | farther/further | farthest/furthest | British: more specific usage |
| little | less | least | Standard |
| much/many | more | most | Standard |
| old | older/elder | oldest/eldest | Older for age, elder for family |

### Adverb Formation (British Context)

**Rule:** Most adverbs are formed by adding -ly to adjectives. British English has some preferences.

Examples:
- Quick → quickly: He runs **quickly**
- Careful → carefully: Drive **carefully**
- Special → especially: This is **especially** important

British preference: "Different from" vs. American "different from/to/than"

### Complete Comparison Table (British Focus)

| Adjective | Comparative | Superlative | Example (Comparative) | British Note |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|--------------|
| tall | taller | tallest | He is taller than me | Standard |
| happy | happier | happiest | She is the happiest | Standard |
| beautiful | more beautiful | most beautiful | She is more beautiful | Standard |
| expensive | more expensive | most expensive | This is most expensive | Standard |
| good | better | best | He is better at math | Standard |

**Negative form:** He is not taller than his brother. / The task is not difficult.
**Question form:** Is she taller than her sister? / Is this the best option?

## Essential Vocabulary

### Supporting Vocabulary
- **adjective** - word describing a noun
- **adverb** - word modifying verb, adjective, or other adverb
- **comparative** - comparing two things
- **superlative** - comparing among three or more
- **linking verb** - connects subject to description

### British Comparative Adverbs
- **Comparing manner:** more carefully, less quickly, better, worse
- **Comparing degree:** more, less, very, extremely, quite, rather, absolutely

### British vs American Adverb Usage
- British: "I quite like it" (meaning 'rather')
- American: "I really like it"
- British: "at the weekend" vs. American "on the weekend"

## Conversation Scenarios

### Describing and Comparing Things in British Context

Practice comparing people, places, and things using proper comparative and superlative forms in the British style, and describing actions with appropriate adverbs.

Key grammar to practice:
- "This book is more interesting than that one" (comparative)
- "She runs faster than I do" (adverb comparative)
- "He speaks English very well" (adverb)
- "This is the most beautiful place I've seen" (superlative)

## Practice Patterns

- Convert adjectives to adverbs with British preferences
- Form comparative and superlative sentences with British usage
- Identify correct adjective position in sentences
- Distinguish between adjectives and adverbs in British context
- Create sentences using irregular comparatives and superlatives

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- "She is more taller" → "She is taller" (double comparative)
- "He runs good" → "He runs well" (use adverb with verbs)
- "She sings beautiful" → "She sings beautifully" (use adverb to describe action)
- "He is the most tallest" → "He is the tallest" (double superlative)
- "The weather is more better" → "The weather is better" (wrong comparative form)

## Cultural Notes

British English often uses "quite" in a way that might confuse Americans: "I quite like it" means "I rather like it" (moderate positive) rather than "I very much like it" as Americans might interpret. Also, British English sometimes uses "different to" instead of "different from" when comparing, though "different from" is more standard in both varieties.

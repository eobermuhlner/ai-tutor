## Conversation Scenarios

The AI tutor will guide you through conversations about:

### Asking for Directions - Formal

Practice asking for directions using formal register.

Topics to cover:
- "Scusi, dov'è la stazione?" (Excuse me, where is the train station?)
- "Vada sempre dritto" (Go straight)
- "Sono circa dieci minuti a piedi" (It's about ten minutes on foot)

### Asking for Directions - Informal

Practice asking for directions using informal register.

Topics to cover:
- "Scusa, come arrivo al Duomo?" (Excuse me, how do I get to the Duomo?)
- "Vai dritto per questa strada" (Go straight on this street)
- "Non puoi sbagliare!" (You can't go wrong!)

### More Complex Directions

Practice giving and receiving complex directions.

Topics to cover:
- "Prenda la prima strada a destra" (Take the first road on the right)
- "Attraversi il ponte" (Cross the bridge)
- "Sulla destra" (On the right)

### Ending the Direction Conversation

Practice concluding a conversation after receiving directions.

Topics to cover:

### Describing Location

Practice describing where things are using prepositions.

Topics to cover:
- "La farmacia è accanto alla banca" (The pharmacy is next to the bank)
- "Di fronte al supermercato" (Across from the supermarket)
- "Tra la banca e il bar" (Between the bank and the bar)

## Practice Patterns

- Practice asking "Dov'è...?" with different places
- Give directions to your house or a familiar place
- Use left and right: "a destra" and "a sinistra"
- Practice counting streets: "la prima strada" (the first street), "la seconda strada" (the second street)
- Describe where something is using prepositions: "è vicino a...", "è di fronte a..."
- Role-play being a tourist and a local giving directions

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- Confusing "destra" (right) with "sinistra" (left)
- Forgetting to use "a" with directions: "gira a destra" not "gira destra"
- Using masculine article with feminine words: "il strada" should be "la strada"
- Saying "dove è" instead of "dov'è" (contraction is standard)
- Forgetting the imperative: saying "tu giri" instead of just "gira"
- Using informal imperative "va'" in formal situations (should be "vada")
- Confusing "vicino" (near) with "vicino a" (near to - needs "a" before the place)
- Not understanding that distances in Italy are often given in meters and walking time, not blocks

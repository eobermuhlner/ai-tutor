## Practice Patterns

- Order a complete Italian meal: antipasto, primo, secondo, contorno, dolce
- Practice saying "Vorrei..." with different foods
- Ask your tutor "Ti piace...?" (Do you like...?) about different foods
- Role-play being a customer and a waiter
- Practice asking for the check politely: "Il conto, per favore"
- Learn to pronounce Italian food names correctly

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- Ordering cappuccino after 11 AM or with meals (Italians drink it only at breakfast!)
- Forgetting to use partitive articles: saying "voglio vino" instead of "vorrei del vino"
- Using "voglio" (I want) in restaurants - always use "vorrei" (I would like) for politeness
- Confusing "conto" (check) with "conta" (he/she counts)
- Forgetting gender of food words: "il pasta" should be "la pasta" (feminine)
- Not knowing about "coperto" - a small cover charge per person at Italian restaurants
- Expecting free water - you must order "acqua" (it's not automatically served for free)

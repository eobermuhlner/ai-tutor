## This Week's Goals

- Talk about your family members in Italian
- Use possessive adjectives correctly
- Describe people's appearance and personality
- Learn Italian family culture and terms

## Grammar Focus

### Possessive Adjectives

**Rule:** Possessive adjectives take the definite article and agree in gender/number with the thing possessed (not the possessor)

**Singular:**
- il mio/la mia (my)
- il tuo/la tua (your - informal)
- il suo/la sua (his/her/your - formal)

**Plural:**
- i miei/le mie (my)
- i tuoi/le tue (your - informal)
- i suoi/le sue (his/her/your - formal)

Examples:
- il mio fratello (my brother)
- la mia sorella (my sister)
- i miei genitori (my parents)
- le sue sorelle (his/her sisters)

**EXCEPTION:** No article with singular family members!
- mio padre (my father) NOT il mio padre
- mia madre (my mother) NOT la mia madre
- BUT: i miei genitori (my parents) - plural uses article

### The Verb "Avere" (To Have) - Review

Use "avere" to talk about age and family:
- Ho 25 anni (I am 25 years old)
- Ho due fratelli (I have two brothers)

## Conversation Scenarios

The AI tutor will guide you through conversations about:

### Talking About Family

Practice discussing family members and their characteristics.

Topics to cover:
- "Hai fratelli o sorelle?" (Do you have brothers or sisters?)
- "Ho un fratello e una sorella" (I have a brother and a sister)
- "Quanti anni hanno?" (How old are they?)
- "Vivono qui?" (Do they live here?)

### Describing Family Members

Practice describing physical appearance and personality traits of family members.

Topics to cover:

- "Mio padre è alto e simpatico" (My father is tall and nice)
- "Mia madre è molto gentile" (My mother is very kind)
- "È insegnante" (She is a teacher)

## Practice Patterns

- Describe your family: "Ho [number] fratelli/sorelle"
- Use possessives: "mio padre", "mia madre", "i miei genitori"
- Ask about family: "Hai fratelli?", "Quanti siete in famiglia?"
- Describe appearance: "alto", "basso", "giovane"
- Describe personality: "simpatico", "gentile", "intelligente"

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- Using article with singular family members: "il mio padre" should be "mio padre"
- Forgetting article with plural family members: "miei genitori" should be "i miei genitori"

## This Week's Goals

- Master common Italian greetings for different times of day
- Learn how to ask "How are you?" and respond appropriately
- Practice formal vs. informal address
- Build confidence with basic courtesy expressions

## Grammar Focus

### Formal vs. Informal "You"

**Rule:** Italian has two forms of "you" - tu (informal) and Lei (formal)

Examples:
- Come stai? (informal - How are you?)
- Come sta? (formal - How are you?)
- Tu sei mio amico (You are my friend - informal)
- Lei è il professore (You are the teacher - formal)

Patterns to Practice:
- Use tu with friends, family, children
- Use Lei with strangers, elders, professional settings
- When in doubt, start with Lei
- Note: Lei (formal you) takes the 3rd person singular verb form

### Subject Pronouns

**Rule:** Subject pronouns are often omitted in Italian because verb endings indicate the subject

Examples:
- (Io) sto bene (I am fine)
- (Tu) parli italiano (You speak Italian)
- (Lui) è di Roma (He is from Rome)

Patterns to Practice:
- Include pronouns only for emphasis or clarity
- Learn to recognize subjects from verb endings

## Conversation Scenarios

The AI tutor will guide you through conversations about:

### Meeting Someone for the First Time

Practice formal greetings and polite introductions in Italian.

Topics to cover:
- "Buongiorno! Come sta?" (Good morning! How are you? - formal)
- "Molto bene, grazie. E Lei?" (Very well, thank you. And you?)
- "Mi chiamo Maria" (My name is Maria)
- "Molto lieta" (Pleased to meet you)

### Greeting a Friend

Practice casual greetings with informal register.

Topics to cover:
- "Ciao! Come stai?" (Hi! How are you?)
- "Bene! E tu?" (Fine! And you?)
- "Che bello vederti!" (Nice to see you!)
- "A presto!" (See you soon!)

## Practice Patterns

- Greet your tutor at different times of day (morning, afternoon, evening)
- Practice introducing yourself using "Mi chiamo..." (My name is...)
- Ask "Come stai?" and respond with different states (bene, male, così così)
- Practice both formal and informal registers in appropriate contexts
- End conversations with different farewell expressions

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- Forgetting to use Lei (capital L) for formal "you" vs. lei (lowercase) meaning "she"
- Using "ciao" in formal situations (use "buongiorno" or "arrivederci" instead)
- Confusing "piacere" (nice to meet you) with "per piacere" (please - less common than "per favore")
- Pronouncing double consonants incorrectly (e.g., "bello" should have a strong double-l sound)
- Using "buonasera" too early (typically used after 4-5 PM)

## Cultural Notes

- Italians often use physical greetings (handshakes, kisses on cheeks depending on region)
- "Piacere" is said when meeting someone for the first time, not used casually
- Greetings are important in Italian culture and skipping them is considered rude
- The time for switching from "buongiorno" to "buonasera" is typically around 6-7 PM
- "Ciao" is only for familiar relationships, never for strangers or business

## Pronunciation Focus

- Double consonants are pronounced as two separate sounds: "bello" (bell-o) vs "velo" (vay-lo)
- The "gl" sound as in "piacere" is pronounced like the "lli" in "million"
- Stress typically falls on the second-to-last syllable
- The "h" in Italian is always silent (as in "hotel", "hanno")
- The "gn" sound as in "signore" is pronounced as "ni" in "onion"

## Additional Vocabulary

### Time-Specific Greetings
- **Buongiorno** - Good morning / Good day (until ~1 PM)
- **Buon pomeriggio** - Good afternoon (1-6 PM)
- **Buonasera** - Good evening (after 6 PM)
- **Buonanotte** - Good night (for sleeping)

### Greeting Responses
- **Tutto bene** - All good
- **Così così** - So-so
- **Non c'è male** - Not bad
- **Grazie per aver chiesto** - Thank you for asking

### Polite Expressions
- **Mi permetta** - Allow me (more formal than "permesso")
- **Per cortesia** - Out of courtesy (rarely used for "please")
- **Buon proseguimento** - Good continuation (when leaving)

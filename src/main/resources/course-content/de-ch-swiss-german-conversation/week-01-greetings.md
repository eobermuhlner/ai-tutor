- Get comfortable with Swiss pronunciation patterns

## Grammar Focus

### Formal vs. Informal "You"

**Rule:** Swiss High German, like Standard German, distinguishes between *du* (informal) and *Sie* (formal).

Examples:
- Wie geht es dir? — How are you? (informal)
- Wie geht es Ihnen? — How are you? (formal)
- Du bist mein Freund. — You are my friend. (informal)
- Sie sind der Lehrer. — You are the teacher. (formal)

**Patterns to Practice:**
- Use *du* with friends, family, children
- Use *Sie* in professional or polite contexts, or with strangers
- Verbs change depending on *du* or *Sie*:
> - Du bist → Sie sind
> - Du heisst → Sie heissen
- When in doubt, start with *Sie*

**Swiss Note:** The Swiss tend to be somewhat more formal than Germans, maintaining *Sie* longer in professional relationships.

### Subject Pronouns

**Rule:** Swiss High German subject pronouns work exactly like Standard German.

| Pronoun | English | Example |
|----------|----------|----------|
| ich | I | Ich bin Anna. — I am Anna. |
| du | you (informal) | Du bist nett. — You are nice. |
| er/sie/es | he/she/it | Er ist müde. — He is tired. |
| wir | we | Wir sind Freunde. — We are friends. |
| ihr | you all (informal plural) | Ihr seid hier. — You are here. |
| sie | they | Sie sind glücklich. — They are happy. |
| Sie | you (formal) | Sie sind freundlich. — You are kind. |

**Tip:** The formal *Sie* is always capitalized.

### Swiss Orthography: No ß (Eszett)

**CRITICAL RULE:** Swiss High German NEVER uses ß (Eszett). Always write ss instead.

German (Germany) → Swiss High German:
- Straße → **Strasse** (street)
- Grüße → **Grüsse** (greetings)
- groß → **gross** (big)
- heißen → **heissen** (to be called)
- weiß → **weiss** (white/know)
- Fußball → **Fussball** (football)

This is official and universal in Swiss orthography — the ß simply does not exist.

## Conversation Scenarios

### Meeting Someone for the First Time (Formal)

Practice formal greetings and polite introductions in Swiss High German.

Topics to cover:
- "Guten Tag! Wie geht es Ihnen?" (Good day! How are you? - formal)
- "Sehr gut, danke. Und Ihnen?" (Very well, thank you. And you? - formal)
- "Ich heisse Anna Müller" (My name is Anna Müller - note: heisse not heiße!)
- "Freut mich" / "Schön, Sie kennenzulernen" (Nice to meet you - formal)

### Greeting a Friend (Informal)

Practice casual greetings with informal register.

Topics to cover:
- "Hallo! Wie geht's?" (Hi! How's it going?)
- "Gut, danke! Und dir?" (Good, thanks! And you?)
- "Was machst du so?" (What are you doing these days?)
- "Bis später!" / "Tschüss!" / "Adieu!" (See you later! / Bye!)

### Using French Loanwords

Practice common French-origin words in Swiss German conversation.

Topics to cover:
- "Merci!" instead of "Danke!" (very common in Switzerland)
- "Pardon" for "Entschuldigung" (excuse me)
- "Adieu" as a common farewell
- "Salut!" (informal hello/bye among young people)

## Pronunciation Focus

### Swiss High German Pronunciation Differences

**The "r" Sound:**
- In Switzerland, "r" is typically an alveolar trill [r] (rolled r)
- NOT the uvular [ʁ] common in Germany
- Practice: *gross, Frau, Grüsse, richtig*

**Clearer Articulation:**
- Swiss High German pronounces word-final -e more clearly
- Less vowel reduction than in Germany
- Example: *bitte* pronounced [ˈbɪtə] not [ˈbɪtə̥]

**The "ch" Sound:**
- Two main sounds (same as Standard German):
    - In *ich, nicht*: soft sound (like "hue" without h)
    - In *Bach, acht*: harsher sound in the throat

**Umlauts (ä, ö, ü):**
- *ä* = like "e" in *bed*
- *ö* = rounded lips, like "sir" but shorter
- *ü* = lips rounded, tongue forward (like French *tu*)

Practice words:
*ich – mich – kühl – schön – Mädchen – Grüsse – heissen*

---

## Practice Patterns

- Greet your tutor in the morning, afternoon, and evening
- Introduce yourself using "Ich heisse..." (with ss!) or "Mein Name ist..."
- Ask "Wie geht's?" or "Wie geht es Ihnen?"
- Practice both *du* and *Sie* forms
- End conversations with various farewell expressions: Tschüss, Auf Wiedersehen, Adieu
- Use "Merci" instead of "Danke" in casual contexts
- Write words with ss, never ß: gross, heissen, Strasse, Grüsse

---

## Common Mistakes to Watch

- Using ß in written Swiss High German: "heißt" → **"heisst"** (ALWAYS ss!)
- Writing "Grüße" → **"Grüsse"** (no ß in Swiss!)
- Using *du* in formal contexts (default to *Sie* with strangers)
- Confusing *Bitte* (please/you're welcome) and *Danke* (thank you)
- Forgetting to capitalize *Sie* when it means "you (formal)"
- Saying *Gute Nacht* as a greeting (it's only for bedtime)
- Pronouncing the rolled "r" with a German uvular "r"

## Cultural Notes

### Swiss High German vs. Swiss German Dialect

**IMPORTANT:** This course teaches **Swiss High German** (the Swiss variant of Standard German), NOT Swiss German dialect (Schweizerdeutsch).

- **Swiss High German** = Written and formal spoken language (news, education, business)
- **Swiss German dialect** = Daily spoken language (varies by canton: Züritüütsch, Bärndütsch, etc.)

In daily life:
- Swiss people speak dialect with each other
- They switch to High German for formal contexts, with foreigners, or in writing
- Swiss High German sounds more "bookish" in spontaneous use
- Learning Swiss High German allows you to communicate in formal and written contexts

### Formality and Politeness

- Swiss culture values politeness and formality
- Using *Sie* shows respect, especially in business or with elders
- People usually switch to *du* only when invited
- The Swiss tend to maintain formal address longer than Germans
- "Merci" (from French) is very common and perfectly acceptable in Swiss German

### Multilingual Influence

- Switzerland has four national languages: German, French, Italian, Romansh
- Many French words are integrated into Swiss High German: Merci, Billet, Portemonnaie
- This reflects the multilingual nature of Swiss society

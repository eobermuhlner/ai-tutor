- Understand topic-comment structure
- Apply correct word order in sentences
- Form simple sentences with proper structure

## Grammar Focus

### Cantonese Sentence Structure
**Rule:** Cantonese follows Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) word order, similar to English, but with significant differences in modifiers and particles.

**Basic Structure:** [Subject] + [Verb] + [Object]
**Example:** Ngóh hek fan
**Translation:** I eat rice

**Extended Structure:** [Subject] + [Time] + [Place] + [Manner] + [Verb] + [Object]
**Example:** Keui zaap dihk zoi gaa laai hek fan
**Translation:** He yesterday at home lazily eat rice

### Topic-Comment Structure
**Rule:** Cantonese often uses topic-comment structure where the topic is marked and the rest is commentary about that topic

**Structure:** [Topic] + [Comment]
**Example:** Keui ngóh bat hei
**Literal:** Him I don't like
**Translation:** I don't like him

**With topic markers (係...嘅 - hai...ge):**
**Example:** Hai keui lai ge
**Literal:** Is him come GE
**Translation:** It was him who came

### Basic Word Order Rules
**Time expressions** generally come after the subject and before the verb:
- Ngóh **zaap dihk** hek fan (I **today** eat rice)
- Keui **mui dihk** luk dihk kut (He **every day** six o'clock get up)

**Place expressions** come after time and before the verb:
- Ngóh **zoi gaa** hek fan (I **at home** eat rice)
- Keui **zoi hok haau** hok haak (He **at school** study)

**Manner expressions** (how something is done) come before the verb:
- Keui **foi lok dik** sing go (He **happily** sing song)
- Ngóh **jung sam dik** bong zo keui (I **enthusiastically** help him)

### Common Sentence Patterns

#### Statement Pattern
**Structure:** Subject + Verb + Object
**Examples:**
- Ngóh hok haak Cantones (I study Cantonese)
- Keui hai laau si (He is a teacher)
- Ngóh men yau saam go ping go (We have three apples)

#### Yes/No Question Pattern
**Structure:** Add 咩 (me) or 嗎 (maa) at the end of a statement
**Examples:**
- Néih hai laau si **maa**? (Are you a teacher?)
- Keui hek fan **me**? (Does he eat rice?)

#### Wh- Question Pattern
**Structure:** Replace the questioned element with a question word
**Examples:**
- **Bī** hai laau si? (Who is the teacher?)
- Néih **zoi bin loi** hok haak? (Where do you study?)
- Néih **dim si hou** kut kut? (When do you get up?)

#### Negation Pattern
**Structure:** Add 唔 (m̀h) or 冇 (mou) before the verb
**Examples:**
- Ngóh **m̀h** hek yuhk (I don't eat meat)
- Keui **mou** lai (He didn't come/didn't come)

### Sentence Components

#### Subjects
**Rule:** Usually definite and known to speaker/listener

**Examples:**
- **Ngóh** hek fan (I eat rice)
- **Keui** heoi hok haau (He goes to school)
- **Ze ge yan** hán hóu (This person is very good)

#### Verbs
**Rule:** Cantonese verbs do not conjugate for tense, number, or person

**Examples:**
- Ngóh **hek** (I eat)
- Keui **hek** (He eats)
- Ngóh men **hek** (We eat)
- Zaap dihk ngóh **hek** lou (Yesterday I ate - past marker 啦)

#### Objects
**Rule:** Direct objects come after the verb

**Examples:**
- Ngóh hek **fan** (I eat rice)
- Keui hon **din si** (He watches TV)
- Ngóh men hok haak **Cantones** (We study Cantonese)

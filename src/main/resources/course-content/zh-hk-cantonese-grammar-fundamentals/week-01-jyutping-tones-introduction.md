## This Week's Goals

- Master the Jyutping romanization system
- Understand Cantonese tones and their importance
- Recognize initials and finals in Jyutping
- Apply correct pronunciation patterns

## Grammar Focus

### Jyutping System
**Rule:** Jyutping is the standard romanization system for Cantonese, using the Latin alphabet to represent Cantonese sounds with tone numbers

**Initials (聲母 - sēngmou):**
- **b, p, m, f** - bilabial and labiodental consonants
- **d, t, n, l** - alveolar consonants
- **g, k, ng, h** - velar consonants (note: **ng** is initial in Cantonese)
- **gw, kw** - labialized velar consonants (unique to Cantonese)
- **z, c, s** - alveolar sibilants
- **j** - palatal approximant (as in English "yes")

**Special Notes:**
- **ng** can be initial in Cantonese (unlike English)
- **gw, kw** are labialized consonants unique to Cantonese
- **j** represents a palatal sound similar to English "y"

### Finals (韻母 - wanmou)
**Simple Finals:**
- **aa, a, e, i, o, u, oe, yu** - basic vowel sounds
- **m, n, ng** - nasal consonants (can be finals)

**Compound Finals:**
- **aai, aau, aam, aan, aang, aap, aat, aak**
- **ei, eu, em, en, eng, ep, et, ek**
- **i, ip, it, ik, im, in, ing**
- **ou, oi, on, ong, ot, ok**
- **u, ui, un, ung, ut, uk**
- **yu, yum, yun, yup, yut**

**Complex Finals:**
- **aa, aai, aau** - long vowel combinations
- **oeng, oek, oey** - complex combinations

### Cantonese Tones
**Rule:** Cantonese has nine tones, traditionally numbered 1-9, with six distinct contour tones and three entering tones

**Level Tones:**
- **1 (high level)** - high and level (e.g., **sī** 詩 poem)
- **2 (mid rising)** - mid and rising (e.g., **sí** 史 history)
- **3 (low falling)** - low and falling (e.g., **sì** 試 test)

**Rising Tones:**
- **4 (low rising)** - low and rising (e.g., **sih** 時 time)
- **5 (high rising)** - high and rising (e.g., **síh** 市 market)
- **6 (mid level)** - mid and level (e.g., **sih** 事 matter)

**Entering Tones (short/checked tones):**
- **7 (high entering)** - high and abrupt (e.g., **sāt** 七 seven)
- **8 (mid entering)** - mid and abrupt (e.g., **sāt** 雪 snow)
- **9 (low entering)** - low and abrupt (e.g., **sāt** 舌 tongue)

**Tone Numbers in Jyutping:**
- Tone 1: high level (no number or 1)
- Tone 2: mid rising (2)
- Tone 3: low falling (3)
- Tone 4: low rising (4)
- Tone 5: high rising (5)
- Tone 6: mid level (6)
- Tones 7-9: entering tones (7, 8, 9)

### Pronunciation Guide
**Key Points:**
1. Cantonese tones are musical contours - they change pitch throughout the syllable
2. Entering tones are shorter and end abruptly with p, t, k consonants
3. The **ng** sound can begin syllables in Cantonese (unlike English)
4. **gw, kw** are labialized consonants - lips rounded while pronouncing
5. Vowel quality and length are important for meaning

## Practice Patterns

- Pronounce Jyutping with correct tones using tone drills
- Practice initials and finals combinations
- Focus on entering tones (short/checked tones)
- Drill tone sets to master the nine-tone system

- "jóu gín" → "jóu gin" (incorrect final sound)
- "ngóh hai" ✓ (correct 1st and 6th tones)
